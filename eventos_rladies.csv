R-Ladies Barcelona,Scalable Machine Learning in R and Python with H2O,2016-12-05,19:00,58,"<p>&lt;a&gt;L'Erin LeDell&lt;/a&gt; (Machine Learning Scientist a H2O.ai)  farà una xerrada en anglès sobre Machine Learning amb R, Python i H2O. L'Erin també va ajudar a crear R-Ladies Global. Vine i aprèn machine learning amb nosaltres! </p> <p>Aquesta trobada és una trobada conjunta de R-Ladies i PyLadiesBCN, recolzada per la Comissió d’Igualtat de la Facultat de Matemàtiques i  Informàtica de l'UB que ens cedeix una sala.</p> <p><b>És millor venir amb el vostre portatil, cargat, si voleu utilizar els paquets quan parla l'Erin, i millor si installeu el paquet h2o (es diu el mateix en Python i R) abans de venir.</b></p> <p>********************************************************</p> <p>The focus of this talk is scalable machine learning using the H2O <a href=""http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r"">R</a> and <a href=""http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/python"">Python</a> packages.  <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3"">H2O</a> is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster).  The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface. </p> <p>Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or ""Super Learners"", from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble"">h2oEnsemble</a> R package.</p> <p>R and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and are <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials#r-tutorials"">available on GitHub</a> for attendees to follow along on their laptops. <b>So please bring a charged laptop if you want to try the code! Please also install the h2o package before coming (h2o package on CRAN, in Python pip install h2o)</b></p> <p>## Speaker Bio</p> <p><a href=""http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/"">Erin LeDell</a> is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at <a href=""http://www.h2o.ai/"">H2O.ai</a>, the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3"">H2O</a>.  She is the author of a handful of machine learning related <a href=""http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/software.html"">software packages</a>, including the <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble"">h2oEnsemble</a> R package for ensemble learning with H2O. Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io (acquired by GE in 2016) and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode in 2012) and the founder of DataScientific, Inc.</p> "

R-Ladies Melbourne,"Learn About R Notebooks, aheatmap Package and Interactive Graphics",2017-02-20,17:30,102,"<p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/b/6/600_458490390.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne is pleased to announce the first event of the year. We will be hosting two amazing women! Let's learn more about life-saving features of R together while networking and helping each other. Snacks and beverages will be provided.</p> <p>Here are the details of the event. </p> <p><b>Date &amp; Time: </b>Monday, February 20, at 5:30pm</p> <p><b>Location: </b>Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Level 7, Davis Auditorium</p> <p><b>Speakers:</b> Jovana Maksimovic and Natalia Da Silva</p> <p><b>Jovana Maksimovic</b> After completing a Bachelor of Science (Honours) / Bachelor of Bioinformatics at La Trobe University, majoring in biochemistry, genetics and computer science, Dr Maksimovic worked at the Department of Primary Industries for two years as part of their graduate program. During this time, she worked on many diverse research projects and developed an interest in the biology of lactation. She began her PhD at Monash in 2007 on a Department of Primary Industries project investigating the expression and regulation of a gene family involved in the production of a subset of milk oligosaccharides that are of interest in infant nutrition. She currently works as a Postdoctoral Scientist in the bioinformatics group at Murdoch Childrens Research Institute. Dr Maksimovic currently works on the analysis of epigenetic data, with a focus on methylation, particularly in immune cells.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Some of my new favourite things for working with R</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> As a bioinformatician, I analyse different types of high-dimensional data to answer biological questions. My work requires a lot of data exploration and is often highly iterative. R markdown has become indispensable for keeping my projects organised, reproducible and maintaining version control. However, when working with large datasets involving lots of plots, it was tedious to have to render an entire document to see the results of changes to a single plot. Alternatively, each plot had to be refined on its own, which was acceptable but could become error prone when preceding code was changed. The recent introduction of R notebooks in RStudio 1.0.0 has revolutionised how I work with R markdown. The ability to view plots/results in the source has made editing easy and robust, whilst retaining all the reproducibility and version control perks of traditional R markdown. My recent discovery of the aheatmap function in the NMF CRAN package has also made my life a lot easier by drastically simplifying the code require to create an informative heatmap.  </p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Natalia Da Silva </b>is a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University working with Dianne Cook and Heike Hofmann. She completed her M.S. in Statistics at Iowa State University working in network meta-analysis with  Bayesian inference in Spring 2014 and received a double  B.S. in Economics (Spring 2009) and in Statistics (Spring 2008) at University of the Republic (Montevideo, Uruguay). Her Ph.D. thesis topic is bagged projection methods for supervised classification in big data. She is interested in data mining, prediction, exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics, reproducible research and meta-analysis. </p> <p>She enjoys being outdoors and her favorite season is summer, therefore she is happy to be in Australia then.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Interactive graphics for visually diagnosing forest classifiers in R.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> This talk describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which with interactive graphics can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this talk, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages.</p> <p>Sign up now!! </p> <p>We are looking forward to seeing you,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "

R-Ladies Melbourne,Building easy and interactive dashboards in R with flexdashboard,2017-03-30,17:30,70,"<p>Dear all,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne is now announcing its March event! Thanks to Zendesk! They provide us drinks and pizzas as well!!</p> <p>We invite you to participate in our ""Meet an R-Lady"" session which will occur prior to the talks during each meetup. All you need to do is to tell us about yourself for 3 mins. As we'd like to build strong relationships with our women, we'd like to get to know each one of you better and wouldn't it be great if you get to know the others? Please email us if you'd like to volunteer!</p> <p>Our speaker Kaushik Lakshman previously gave a talk about flexdashboards in  Melbourne Users of R Network with fantastic feedback from the audience. So we invited him to share his knowledge with R-Ladies and he kindly accepted our invitation. Here are the details of his talk.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Building easy and interactive dashboards in R with flexdashboard </p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> Outputs of analyses or analytics pipelines often contain visualisations, summarised data and commentary around it. While this can be achieved using multiple methods such as good old fashioned Powerpoints, RMarkdowns or Shiny Apps; the good folks at R Studio have given analysts and data scientists a new alternative via a package called flexdashboard. Find out how easy it is to build flexible, attractive and interactive dashboards with R. </p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a big fan of R. He works at Betfair Australia, the world's largest betting exchange. He came across the flexdashboard package a few months ago and has already implemented a few in his organisation. He was enamoured by its ease of use and value it provided and would like to share that with the R Ladies group. He's going to take us through flexdashboards and its different features, with examples and code Betfair's after which all attendees hopefully are in a position to create their own dashboards with ease.</p> <p>Signup now!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "
R-Ladies Melbourne,Project Management and Version Control with Git in RStudio,2017-05-04,17:30,51,"<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>We hope you all had a restful Easter break and ready to catch up again with the R-world!! We weren't able to schedule an event in April due to the Easter break, so there will be two R-Ladies meet-ups in May. Here are the details of the first one.</p> <p>This talk will be presented by one our dedicated group organisers, Soroor Zadeh, on 4th of May.  Soroor is a Research Assistant in the Division of Bioinformatics at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. She has a background in Statistics and currently works on gene regulation mechanisms in normal and cancer cells. </p> <p><b>Title:</b> Project Management and Version Control with Git in R-Studio</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> As a project evolves and more results are produced, a systematic way of keeping records of the changes to the analysis becomes vital. If you are developing a software or working on scripts in your day-to-day tasks, you would have realised that you need a tool that would allow you to keep track of all the changes you make to the project throughout the development process without requiring you to duplicate files and make copies of them. Such a tool would ideally also allow you to revert any recent changes to the script to the old ones or previous versions. This is called Version Control and Git is one such a tool that provides this facility. I will be introducing basic concepts in Version Control and demonstrate how to use Git in your routine analysis.</p> <p>The second event will be on 22nd of May so add it to your calendar if you are interested in hands-on Twitter Sentimental Analysis!! Details for this event are coming soon!</p> <p>We are looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>Goknur Giner</p> <p>On behalf of R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "

R-Ladies Melbourne,How to analyze and combine multiple high-dimensional datasets?,2017-08-22,17:30,72,"<p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/6/8/600_463498984.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne is now announcing its August event! In this months event we will be hosting Dr Kim-Anh Lê Cao, who very recently joined the University of Melbourne as a Senior Lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Centre for Systems Genomics. She will be giving the main presentation of the evening.</p> <p>Title: How to analyse and combine multiple high-dimensional datasets?</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available biological data coming from different sources. Combining such large-scale data sets can lead to the discovery of important insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner.</p> <p>During this talk, I will introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. The toolkit provides a wide range of methods  to statistically integrate several data sets at once and probe relationships between heterogeneous data sets. mixOmics has been developed for ‘omics biological data (hence the name!) but the methods are applicable for other analytical problems where dimension reduction and data integration are required. I will relate my R journey through the development of the package and share tips and pitfalls to avoid when developing large R packages.</p> <p>Feel free to bring a laptop to have a go at mixOmics (don’t forget to download the latest version on the CRA: mixOmics 6.2.0 ) and download the tutorial material: <a href=""http://mixomics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tutorial-Rladies.zip""><a href=""http://mixomics.org/wp-content/"" class=""linkified"">http://mixomics.org/wp-content/</a>...</a>­</p> <p>Kim-Anh Lê Cao was awarded her PhD in 2008 at the Université de Toulouse, France.  Soon after she moved to Australia and was appointed as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland. From 2009 to 2013 she was appointed as a Research Biostatistician at QFAB Bioinformatics where she developed a multidisciplinary approach to her research. In 2014 Dr Lê Cao was hired at the biomedical research UQ Diamantina Institute and in 2015 was awarded an NHMRC Career Development Fellowship. She very recently joined the University of Melbourne as a Senior Lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Centre for Systems Genomics. Dr Kim-Anh Lê Cao is an expert in multivariate statistical methods and novel developments. Since 2009, her team has been working on developing mixOmics dedicated to the integrative analysis of `omics' data to help researchers mine and make sense of biological data (<a href=""http://www.mixomics.org/""><a href=""http://www.mixOmics.org"" class=""linkified"">http://www.mixOmics.org</a></a>).</p> <p>Hope to see you all there!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "

This month join us to hear from Elisabeth Vogel, a PhD student at the Australian-German Climate &amp; Energy College at the University of Melbourne. Her research interests are centered on climate change impacts on ecological and human systems, with a particular focus on climate extreme events and agriculture. Within her PhD, Elisabeth investigates the impact of extreme weather events on global crop yields using a range of statistical methods. Before her PhD, Elisabeth completed a degree in Environmental Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Using random forests to better understand the impacts of climate extreme events on food production</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b>Climate extreme events, such as droughts or heatwaves – have a severe impact on agricultural productivity worldwide. It is important to understand how such extreme events have affected global food production in the past in order to increase the resilience of the global food system to such events in the future. In this presentation, I will talk about how random forests - a machine learning algorithm - can help to detangle the complex interactions between climate and agricultural variables. In the first part of this presentation, I will introduce the concept of random forests, how they are used for regression and classification problems and how to build random forests in R using the randomForest package. In the second part I will talk about how I applied random forests to global climate and agricultural datasets to look at how climate extreme events affected agricultural production.</p> <p>This month is also R-Ladies Melbourne first anniversary! So be sure to come at 5:30pm for cake and bubbles to celebrate with us!</p> <p><b>Location:</b><br/>This month our event is taking place at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) at 1G Royal Parade Parkville. To access WEHI please take note of the map and directions below.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/b/e/600_465585758.jpeg"" /></p> <p>An R-Ladies member will be waiting at the Gene Technology Access Centre entry to point you in the right direction.</p> <p>Looking forward to see you all there!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "

It also permits the user to play with the data and make the information more understandable. In addition, interactive data manipulation enables to study the behaviour of a mathematical model, as the parameters of the model are being modified which can be helpful for example in developing interactive education materials.It is even used by newspapers like the New York Times and scientific papers like Science.</p> <p>R shiny is an excellent framework to turn an R analysis into an interactive web application and we will be presenting a two-hour introductory workshop to build interactive apps with R Shiny.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will cover the structure of R Shiny Apps, and the concept of reactivity, where an 'event' such as changing the value of the input or selecting a row in a table, triggers a set of reactions and results in updating the output value. We will also briefly talk about ways to publish and distribute an app publicly.</p> <p>A little about Marie and Soroor:</p> <p>Marie graduated from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse in France in the major of engineering and mathematics, and got her PhD degree on System Biology and Structural Biology Modeling from the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. Marie has joined Terry Speed lab’s as a Postdoctoral research fellow about a year ago, in the Bioinformatics Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.</p> <p>Soroor is a Research Assistant in Davis laboratory, also in the Bioinformatics Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. She joined Davis laboratory in 2014 as a UROP student, and was promoted to a RA in 2016. She is currently doing a part-time masters degree in Statistics at the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>This will be a fantastic workshop and we can't wait to see you all there!</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be provided!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "

For our first event of 2018 Belinda Maher will be joining us to tell us about her work with geospatial data and R.</p> <p>Belinda started her journey in transport data at KiwiRail, where she worked on a $2 billion (NZD) upgrade of Auckland's suburban train network. After returning home to Melbourne, she took up a role at Public Transport Victoria in Operational Performance Analysis.<br/>At PTV Belinda used R to plot the location of stations, stops and timing points and the paths of public transport routes. She created dashboards containing spatial visualisations of Victorian public transport operational performance data.<br/>Belinda now works at Swinburne University, using in R and Tableau on data which is (unfortunately) not about trains. Belinda holds a Bachelor of Science from The University of Melbourne and a Graduate Diploma in Statistics and Operations Research from RMIT.</p> <p>Talk Title:<br/>Public Transport Maps and Geospatial Data in R using PTV GTFS data</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an open standard for publishing public transport schedules and associated geographic location and transport service path information.Public Transport Victoria (PTV) first published a GTFS version of their timetable data in 2015, which enabled Google to begin showing ‘public transit’ options for directions in Victoria within Google maps. This data is publicly available on the PTV website. This talk will cover working with GTFS spatial data to plot maps in R, using the leaflet and sp packages. Belinda will explain how to create zoomable maps of transport paths and stations, and mention some of the challenges of working with this dataset.</p> <p>This meetup is hosted by our wonderful sponsor Zendesk, who will be provided pizza and drinks for us for the evening!</p> <p>We can't wait to see you all there!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> "

Não esqueça de convidar outras ladies a participar!</p> <p>Programação:</p> <p>****<br/>Para começar: uma introdução ao R-Ladies</p> <p>****<br/>Palestra: ""Do armazenamento ao uso dos dados em saúde: REDCap e R""<br/>Palestrante: Karlyse Claudino Belli</p> <p>Resumo: Plataformas colaborativas e gratuitas facilitam o armazenamento, análise e uso dos dados em saúde, podendo gerar informações úteis para pacientes, profissionais e gestores(as). Nessa linha, o uso do REDCap juntamente com o R apresenta uma interoperabilidade adequada para produzir resultados em tempo real a partir de dados coletados sistematicamente.</p> <p>Bio: Karlyse é doutora em Ciências da Saúde com ênfase em Cardiologia pela UFRGS. Atualmente é coordenadora do setor de Registros Clínicos no Instituto de Cardiologia de Porto Alegre e professora/orientadora em programas de pós graduação (lato e stricto sensu).</p> <p>****<br/>Palestra: ""Introdução a análise de dados com pesos amostrais usando o pacote survey""<br/>Palestrante: Vanessa Bielefeldt Leotti</p> <p>Resumo: Em variáveis situações, amostragens complexas são utilizadas para se obter amostras. As unidades de tais amostras muito provavelmente possuirão pesos amostrais diferentes e este peso deve ser incorporado na análise. O pacote survey foi criado com o objetivo de incorporar esses pesos tanto na análise descritiva quanto em análises mais sofisticadas como regressão. Na palestra, se falará brevemente sobre o cálculo de pesos amostrais, sobre a diferença entre amostragem estratificada e por conglomerados e se mostrará exemplos de análises com o survey.</p> <p>Bio: Vanessa é bacharel em Estatística e tem mestrado e doutorado em Epidemiologia. É professora da UFRGS, ministrando a disciplina de Amostragem, entre outras. Usa o R desde a graduação e este é seu software favorito. Atende consultorias no Hospital de Clínicas onde, por força das circunstâncias, tem que usar o SPSS, mas sonha com o dia em que todos entendam R :)</p> <p>****<br/>Encerramento: considerações, sugestões e próximo encontro.</p> <p>Até lá!</p> <p>Lembramos que R-Ladies tem como objetivo proporcionar uma experiência livre de assédio para todos.

Quando tem que entregar algum trabalho, passa mais tempo formatando e tentando entender porque o Word não te obedece do que analisando os dados? Passa raiva quando abre o .doc em outro computador e o documento desformata e vai tudo por água abaixo? Seus problemas acabaram! Nessa breve introdução ao RMarkdown venho mostrar como este formato de documento facilita a formatação de relatórios, integrados com o R, deixando seu documento mais bonito e reproduzível.</p> <p>Bio: Bruna Martini Dalmoro é estatística formada pela UFRGS, trabalha atualmente na Plataforma Digital do Sicredi com modelagem de crédito. Em relacionamento sério com o R há 3 anos.

É muito comum encontrarmos colunas com categorias não padronizadas, como, por exemplo, uma variável Estado com “SP”, “sp”, “Sao Paulo”, “São Paulo” etc, todas indicando o mesmo estado.<br/>O R possui várias funções para manipular textos (ou strings). No entanto, as funções do base não possuem uma interface consistente e cada uma tem a sua forma de passar os parâmetros, dificultando a programação durante a análise.<br/>Pensando nisso, Hadley Wickham deu aquela força para a comunidade R e criou o pacote stringr, que possui uma sintaxe consistente, permitindo o usuário manipular textos com muito mais facilidade.</p> <p>Fonte: <a href=""http://material.curso-r.com/stringr/"" class=""linkified"">http://material.curso-r.com/stringr/</a></p> <p>Bio: Mobile Developer, apaixonada por linguagens de programação e tecnologias.

R-Ladies Canberra,Bayesian modelling with R,2019-03-25,15:00,20,"<p>Bayesian models become more prominent thanks to the modern computing technologies. In this meeting, you will take a Bayes tour with Jiali (Data61, CSIRO) of the basics in Bayesian inference, coding from scratch in R and implementation using Stan software (interface with R)! A normal model will serve as the building block, and then you will go through examples of hierarchical models and semi-parametric models for multilevel data or longitudinal data (different disciplines have different names for essentially the same model, but we will convergence!) The R examples will be demonstrated in R Markdown, so please come along if you are interested in learning basics of R Markdown.</p> <p>Bringing a laptop is totally optional, but you are encouraged to do so if you are keen on having some hands-on experiences of running your own Bayesian models. Don’t worry about taking notes, all the materials and R code will be shared with you later.</p> <p>There will be time for discussions /networking after the tutorial, so make sure to bring any of your questions; there might be experts in the room who can help solving your problems!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p> "
R-Ladies Canberra,Tidying and plotting in R,2019-05-06,13:00,21,"<p>R is primarily known as a tool for statistics and data analysis, but it is also great for ""simpler"" data wrangling and plotting purposes. As R is becoming more accessible and useful in this regards, it is becoming a more viable alternative to Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet-based applications for wrangling, analysing and visualising data. This has resulted in more R-users who are not from the ""hardcore"" STEM disciplines - like linguists, psychologists and researchers in political science. In this talk, Hedvig will introduce the concept of tidy data, the wonders of the tidyverse and ggplot for beginner users of R and experienced users who mainly use non-tidyverse packages.</p> <p>Hedvig (<a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/hedvigskirgard/"" class=""linkified"">https://sites.google.com/site/hedvigskirgard/</a>) is a linguist working on Pacific languages at ANU. She focuses on grammatical structure and diversification, how one language becomes many. This is her final year of her PhD, and one the side she helps other linguists and humanities students with R.</p> <p>Hedvig has kindly shared her slides (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BE_fQv_ov8cCflxCcqa8tC3NY7u1UKH"" class=""linkified"">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BE_fQv_ov8cCflxCcqa8tC3NY7u1UKH</a>), for you to have a glimpse before coming to the event.</p> <p>Please NOTICE that the location for this event has changed to CSIRO black mountain site. The entrance of Synergy building is opposite to discovery centre. We will put a sign at the entrance to show the direction to the meeting room - Stingbark on the ground floor.</p> <p>Beginners and intermediate R users are all encouraged to come!</p> "

Please find below the instruction to download TensorFlow.</p> <p>The talk will take place on the ground level, Hanna Neumann (MSI) building (building 145) on the ANU campus. There will be refreshments in foyer at 5.15 pm, and the talk will start at 6 pm. After the talk, there will be a dinner at China Plate, Kambri precinct ANU. Please RSVP SSA Canberra ([masked]) or R-Ladies Canberra ([masked]) by 27 May if you would like to attend the dinner.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Geostatistics plays a key role in the analysis and prediction of spatial and spatio-temporal phenomena. Spatial/spatio-temporal model fitting generally involves multiple matrix operations that can be slow to execute on a CPU. RStudio's interface to TensorFlow provides an ideal vehicle for doing spatial model fitting on a GPU in a fraction of the time needed by a CPU.</p> <p>I will first briefly talk about Google's TensorFlow and the associated R interface. I will then derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in a simple spatial model and implement maximum-likelihood estimation in R. Finally, I will show how to implement the same fitting procedure using Google's TensorFlow and illustrate the speed improvement when using a GPU. Attendees are invited to bring their own laptop with R and TensorFlow installed (see <a href=""https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/articles/installation.html"" class=""linkified"">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/articles/installation.html</a>).</p> <p>Biography:<br/>Andrew Zammit Mangion is Senior Lecturer and DECRA Research Fellow in the National Institute for Applied Statistics Research Australia (NIASRA), University of Wollongong, Australia. He is a co-author of two books and he has published over 20 peer-reviewed articles in the field of spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. He is also the author of a number of related R packages available on CRAN, including EFDR, FRK, and IDE. In 2013, Andrew was awarded a US National Academy of Sciences prize for his work on the modelling and prediction of armed conflicts.</p> "

R-Ladies Seattle,Learning R and Building Community,2019-05-22,18:00,23,"<p>Mark your calendars! This month we will hear from 2 people about their pathways to learning R and the great community-building that happened along the way. Redfin has kindly offered to host us in their space in downtown Seattle and will be providing pizza.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>* Stefanie Butland, Community Manager at rOpenSci<br/>* Malisa Smith, Bioinformatician at University of Washington</p> <p>Stefanie Butland:<br/>I am the Community Manager for an organization of R practitioners...but I am not an R practitioner. For the first 1.5 years in my job, this was a feature, but lately it has felt more like a bug. In this talk I will introduce rOpenSci, our packages, and our system for transparent software peer review, and then share my story of starting to learn R by (not so) passive absorption of information and best practices from R-Ladies, rOpenSci, and the broader R world.</p> <p>Malisa Smith:<br/>Flow cytometry is commonly used by biologists to measure the abundance of specific molecules in millions of cells, while retaining information at the single-cell level. The resulting high-dimensional, high-throughput datasets have led to the development of unique software for analyzing flow cytometry data.

Mateos (@lpez_elena). Dará una introducción teórica sobre qué es control de versiones y cómo es imprescindible para la colaboración en proyectos técnicos de todo tipo. Configuraremos la herramienta, haremos commits, resolveremos conflictos... es súper intensivo, ¡no os lo perdáis! ☝🏻👩🏻‍💻👀 🧠🤓</p> <p>Lo interesante es que haremos commits en 3 formatos distintos, por lo que si no controlas de R, hay más opciones para aprender practicando con Git.

I do not think, that we are supposed to choose one and live with that for the rest of our lives. So how can we decide which one to use for what purpose?.</p> <p>In this session, we will talk about the first steps of R and Python, for what tasks can these languages be used in the best way, and how. You will be able to try both languages during the session in different environments. We will build some interesting stuff from basic statistical models to some hardcore deep learning algorithms.</p> <p>5:45 - 5:55 --- Break.</p> <p>5:55 - 6:40 --- Second lighting talk: 'Cluster analysis for customer segmentation' by Joselene Marques, Data Scientist @ Justt.</p> <p>You will get a short introduction to customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value) and a quick start to perform cluster analysis in R.<br/>We start by presenting required R packages for data manipulation, cluster analysis and visualization.<br/>Next, we describe two clustering techniques k-MEANS and SOM (self-organizing map).<br/>Finally, we present the result with lots of insightful (and easy to code) plots.</p> <p>6:40 - 7:00 --- Networking.</p> <p>Don't forget to bring your laptops if you want to experiment a little.</p> <p>RSVP, a.s.a.p. as we only have 30 places available!

R-Ladies Copenhagen,April is Shiny!,2019-04-11,17:30,35,"<p>Spring is here! That means this month is all about all things Shiny (if that makes sense)!</p> <p>We have two speakers who are regulars on the R-Ladies Copenhagen circuit, Diana Lucatero and Ivana Hybenova. Special thanks go to Deloitte Risk Advisory for sponsoring this event!</p> <p>Talk 1: Data science- from academia to industry<br/>On this lighting talk, Diana will share her experience deploying advanced analytics in academia &amp; industry with the main focus being the differences in communication &amp; security considerations. The talk will include:<br/>(1) A very introductory sketch of shiny (what it is and why)<br/>(2) A hands on demonstration of how you can build &amp; deploy a simple web app.<br/>(3) A 10 min exploration session of some cool interactive visualizations.<br/>(4) A demonstration on how you can install R packages in a secure manner (it's all about risk, risk!).</p> <p>Diana is a data science consultant in Deloitte Risk Advisory. She has experience with advanced analytics in environmental science &amp; now she is applying her knowledge in the field of risk analytics. In the old days, she was a Matlab junkie, but now she has learned her lesson &amp; joined the shiny-dark-R-side!</p> <p>Talk 2: Using Shiny to troubleshoot machine learning tasks<br/>In this talk, Ivana will show us how to use R Shiny to solve a machine learning task quicker!</p> <p>She has built an app that loads in a cleaned dataset and train several regression models: linear, support vector machine (SVM), random forest for regression, and generalized boosted regression.</p> <p>We will even tune the algorithms from within the app, where Ivana will demonstrate the app and review the code. Even if you have not tried to 'machine-learn' yourself, it is one more reason to join as it will be super easy to perform and understand!</p> <p>Shiny experts: Be aware that this talk is introductory.

Having used basic commands in R before is sufficient, but no knowledge of markdown, latex or anything similar is required.</p> <p>There will be internet access provided by the host.</p> <p>• Who is Claudia Kasper •<br/>I am an animal geneticist currently working as a researcher at Agroscope in Posieux, FR, where I work on breeding sustainable pigs. I started my career as an evolutionary biologist, first working on primates, then switching to humans and finally fish and house mice. In all of those systems I was interested in finding out more about cooperation, the social structure enabling it and the genetic basis of this fascinating biological phenomenon. My research is strongly centred on statistics for which I am using R. Having used Mathematica in the beginning, I was missing a neat way to organise my R scripts and to make reports of my findings. After a lot of frustration and literally days of copy-pasting R output into Word documents I discovered RMarkdown a few years ago and I have been using it ever since. Apart from having neater scripts, I ‘knit’ reports of my results as Word or PDF documents, but also presentations and I am trying to do a webpage with RMarkdown. In my free time I play improvisational theatre in Bern in a group which I co-founded.</p> "

Ele também é formado por tomada de decisão, recomendações, exposição de ideias, etc. A grande questão é: Como expor a minha análise no mercado? Hoje em dia, por exemplo, técnicas como machine learning têm sido bem vistas, mas a análise é mais do que apenas uma boa e eficiente técnica. É preciso saber expor/vender a análise através de relatórios ou dashboards que facilitem a comunicação entre quem está analisando e o público que anseia os resultados. O Shiny é um pacote do R que faz a ponte entre sua análise e uma boa visualização dela. O pacote une também o conceito de existir um servidor onde há processamento e interação com os dados - Server Side - e um local onde são criadas interfaces gráficas recebidas pelo servidor - User Side . O pacote utiliza as linguagens mais usuais de interface gráfica - HTML, CSS e JavaScript – e o mais legal é que você não precisa saber todas elas e ainda assim criar visualizações incríveis apenas usando o R.</p> <p>O encontro será no dia 05/02/2019 no Campus da Praia Vermelha da UFF, Escola de Engenharia, bloco D, Sala 365 (R. Passo da Pátria, São Domingos, Niterói) das 16h às 18h.</p> <p>Contamos com sua presença e participação!!!!!</p> <p>PROGRAMAÇÃO</p> <p>16h - Abertura</p> <p>16h10 - Exercitando o Rcommander (Julia Ferreira - Estatística -UFF)</p> <p>17h - Descobrindo o Shiny: Como tornar sua visualização de dados mais atraente?

R-Ladies Pasadena,R-Ladies Pasadena: Good Practices in R ,2019-01-09,18:30,12,"<p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>Happy new year! Welcome to our second Pasadena R-Ladies meeting. Per your requests, we will have a talk on good practices in R. This session will be led by Zhi Yang who is a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics from the University of Southern California.</p> <p>The talk will be targeted at those who just began their journey in using R or only use it now and then. If you were one of them, you might be at the stage that the excitement and joy, from running awesome analyses and generating data visualization in R, have been taken away by being tired of managing scripts and repeatedly doing things. Then, it might be time to consider developing good practices in R.</p> <p>Based on some widely-known online resources and her own experiences, Zhi will go over a wide range of good practices in R including how to use RStudio projects, name files, customize RStudio, create shortcuts, format codes, write functions, and etc. These tips will hopefully help improve your experiences of programming in R to achieve goals of better managing multiple projects and saving your time in the long run.</p> "

R-Ladies London,Hadley Wickham: What's new in the dplyr 0.7.0,2017-07-25,18:00,72,"<p>In this talk, I'll introduce you to some of the new features in dplyr 0.7.0. To warm up, we'll start of with some of the smaller stuff: new verbs (like pull() and the scoped variants), new data sets, and improved support for case_when(). Next, we'll talk about dplyr and databases and the new dbplyr package. Finally, we'll finish off with the mind-bending tidy evaluation and show how you can write your own<br/>functions that work in the same way as dplyr functions.</p> <p>To get the most of this talk, you should be familiar with the basics of dplyr (e.g. the six key verbs)</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Hadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland.

She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.</p> <p># Dive into dplyr</p> <p>Data is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.</p> <p># What to bring</p> <p>The session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.</p> <p># Important to know</p> <p>This meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.</p> <p>Doors: 6:30pm<br/>Start: 7:00pm<br/>**Please note**: registration for this event is via Eventbrite: <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008</a></p> "

R-Ladies London,"Interpretable Deep Learning with R, Keras and LIME",2018-10-16,18:00,58,"<p>Registration via Eventbrite: <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/interpretable-deep-learning-with-r-lime-and-keras-tickets-50118369392"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/interpretable-deep-learning-with-r-lime-and-keras-tickets-50118369392</a></p> <p>Remember, without an Eventbrite ticket your registration won't be valid!</p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKER</p> <p>R-Ladies London have a great pleasure to host Dr Shirin Glander, a data scientist at codecentric in Munster, Germany. If that wasn't enough, she's also an R-blogger, data enthusiast, organiser of MünsteR, animal lover, ballroom and latin dance teacher! You can read her award-winning blog here: <a href=""https://www.shirin-glander.de/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.shirin-glander.de/</a></p> <p>Shirin will talk about using R to build an interpretable imagine recognition models.</p> <p>ABOUT THE TALK</p> <p>Keras is a high-level open-source deep learning framework that by default works on top of TensorFlow. Keras is minimalistic, efficient and highly flexible because it works with a modular layer system to define, compile and fit neural networks. It has been written in Python but can also be used from within R. Because the underlying backend can be changed from TensorFlow to Theano and CNTK (with more options being developed right now) it is designed to be framework-independent. Models can be trained on CPU or GPU, locally or in the cloud. Shirin will show an example of how to build an image classifier with Keras. We'll be using a convolutional neural net to classify fruits in images. But that's not all! We not only want to judge our black-box model based on accuracy and loss measures - we want to get a better understanding of how the model works. We will use an algorithm called LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to find out what part of the different test images contributed most strongly to the classification that was made by our model. Shirin will introduce LIME and explain how it works. And finally, she will show how to apply LIME to the image classifier we built before, as well as to a pre-trained Imagenet model.</p> <p>MEETUP AGENDA</p> <p>18.00 - 19.00: Doors open and networking.<br/>19.00 - 19.15: Intro in the Data Science at Farfetch<br/>19.15 - 20.30: Shirin's talk + questions<br/>~20.30 - ~21.00: networking</p> <p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br/>We would like to say thanks to our sponsor; tech recruitment agency RedCat Digital (<a href=""https://www.redcat-digital.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.redcat-digital.com/</a>), and to our hosts global ecommerce platform Farfetch (<a href=""https://www.farfetch.com/uk/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.farfetch.com/uk/</a>).

What do you mean you've never heard about Tidy Tuesdays? It's a brilliant data project developed by R4DS learning community to promote the use of R language in Data Science and link mentors and learners. How?</p> <p>Every Tuesday a raw dataset will be posted and an original chart associated with that dataset. The goal is to apply your take on the chart. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of Tidy Tuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater RStats community! So everyone of all skills should participate!</p> <p>Remember, done is better than perfect! It's better to show the progression of your skills with something basic but quick than something very sophisticated but tedious!</p> <p>At the end of the meetup we will publish our graphs and code on Twitter with #TidyTuesday hashtag (fanfares)!</p> <p>So get ready for a fun and hands-on meetup with lots to learn and explore!</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>5:30pm - doors open (pizza and drinks won't last forever!)</p> <p>6pm - quick intros and hellos from R-Ladies and hosts</p> <p>6:15ish pm - start TidyTuesday-ing!!</p> <p>8:45ish pm - publish our amazing work</p> <p>See you all there!</p> <p>We would like to say thanks to our sponsor tech recruitment agency RedCat Digital and to our hosts online mortgage broker Habito.

These kinds of models are often used in longitudinal studies or with time series data. They are powerful as the used maximum likelihood approximations rather than least squares, meaning they can better handle missing data, and competing models can be compared directly. By the end of the workshop you should have a basic grasp of the linear mixed model, how to specify one, how to compare models and how to plot results.</p> <p>The workshop is held by Athanasia Monika Mowinckel, or Mo for short, who is a staff scientist at the Center for Lifespan changes in brain and cognition (LCBC: www.oslobrains.no).

R-Ladies Berlin,R-Ladies London visits R-Ladies Berlin,2018-07-03,18:00,17,"<p>We are happy to welcome R-Lady Grace from London at our additional meet-up session next week!</p> <p># Speaker details</p> <p>Grace Meyer is a commercial analytics expert with proven success in advising business strategy based on data driven insights. She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.</p> <p># Dive into dplyr</p> <p>Data is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.</p> <p># What to bring</p> <p>The session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.</p> <p># Important to know</p> <p>This meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.</p> <p>Please take note of the different time and place of this meet-up! We are going to meet in a small seminar room at the WeWork space at Kuhdamm. Therefore we need to know your complete name (question at RVSPs). Since the room is small we have a limit of participants this time. Therefore we kindly ask to register in the case you're able to join or to resign in time if required to provide your seat for another Lady!</p> <p>After the session we would like to go for a drink and further chats to a close by bar or pizza place.</p> "

This event will be led by a guest, Dr. Suthira Owlarn, coming all the way from the MPI for Molecular Biology in Muenster. Suthira will be teaching us how to use R Shiny, a way to build interactive web applications using R.</p> <p>Shiny is a popular framework for building R-powered interactive web apps and dashboards – and a great way to present your data/analyses to the world! Its ease-of-use makes it beginner-friendly, while its flexibility and extendibility allow more advanced programmers to make use of various skills (e.g. javascript, test-writing).</p> <p>Based on the initial R Ladies Nijmegen survey, the current plan for the workshop assumes fundamental R skills, but no previous shiny experience. It’ll be a presentation with short exercises, followed by a longer hands-on session and Q&amp;A.</p> <p>You can find a more general R concepts refresher to make sure you’re ready for the workshop here: <a href=""https://github.com/sowla/2019-shiny-intro-workshop-Nijmegen-RLadies"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/sowla/2019-shiny-intro-workshop-Nijmegen-RLadies</a></p> <p>About the speaker: Suthira Owlarn is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Münster.

The bulk of the talk will cover the details of the process, focussing on challenges around data import, tidying, transformation, and visualisation. Along the way you'll learn some of the key principles of the tidyverse, centered around an explicit acknowledgement of the human in the loop.</p> <p>While I'll be showing and talking about lots of code, no programming experience is required. This talk contains no formulas.</p> <p># Bio</p> <p>Hadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun.

R-Ladies Auckland,Lessons and highlights from the rOpenSci project,2018-02-20,18:00,30,"<p>Hi All!</p> <p>We are very excited to have another speaker visiting Auckland this February. If you are interested in R, whether a beginner or an expert, then put this in your diary!</p> <p>Doors open at 6pm<br/>Talk will commence at 6:30pm</p> <p># Speaker<br/>Karthik Ram is a Data Scientist at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and Berkeley Institute for Global Change Biology. He is a co-founder of rOpenSci, a collective to support the development of R-based tools which facilitate open science and access to open data.</p> <p># Full Title<br/>Reproducible data science with R: Lessons and highlights from the rOpenSci project</p> <p># Summary<br/>The Open Science movement, which promotes sharing all artifacts of scientific research such as data, code, and methods, is becoming increasingly popular among researchers worldwide. This rapid increase in popularity is evidenced in the thriving ecosystem of tools and also numerous training initiatives that have sprung up at various institutions.</p> <p>One such effort in this space is the rOpenSci project (<a href=""https://ropensci.org"" class=""linkified"">https://ropensci.org</a>). Founded as a grassroots effort six years ago, the project works to promote open and reproducible research by enabling discovery of data, code and software, creating the technical and social infrastructure to enable reproducible research, and advocate for a culture of open science in various disciplines. This community driven project builds upon R’s popularity as a scientific research tool and fills in additional gaps in the computational pipeline by providing tools for data acquisition (from APIs and other source), data manipulation (including an emerging suite for spatial data analysis and mapping), data visualization tools, and data publication tools. Beyond tooling, the project has been working towards promoting best practices in scientific computing (beyond the R language itself) by developing a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software, mentorship, and community development.</p> <p>In this talk I’ll speak about the history and motivations behind the project, demo some of our recent tools that can streamline your data science workflow, and also talk about our efforts to build community through various initiatives.</p> <p>Thanks to our Sponsors:<br/>- rOpenSci project for food and drink<br/>- GridAKL for sponsoring the venue</p> "
R-Ladies Auckland,Is Collaboration in Science split along Gender Lines? Network Analysis in R,2018-04-23,18:00,36,"<p>Hi all,</p> <p>We are excited to announce our next meetup in April presented by Emma Vitz and hosted by Te Pūnaha Matatini.<br/><a href=""http://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz"" class=""linkified"">http://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz</a></p> <p>Doors open at 6pm for 6:30 start.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>When it comes to collaboration in science, who works with whom? The Marsden fund is one of the largest research grants in New Zealand and has been funding research for over 20 years. It provides a glimpse into the networks that produce some of our most groundbreaking scientific research. This talk will look at whether these networks are split along gender lines, and whether this has changed over time.</p> <p>Speaker bio:</p> <p>Emma Vitz is an actuarial analyst at Finity Consulting. She graduated from Victoria University last year with a degree in Statistics and Psychology. Emma loves applying data science and machine learning techniques to all kinds of problems, especially those involving people. She continually pushes herself to learn new aspects of programming and data science, which you can see by following her on Twitter at @EmmaVitz.</p> "
R-Ladies Auckland,Harry Potter and the Rvest of Fanfiction,2018-05-22,18:00,30,"<p>Kia ora koutou!</p> <p>Keeping it super local this time, we are thrilled to announce that our next meetup will be workshop presented by Liza Bolton. If you are new to using R or web scraping, want some ideas for using the R package rvest, or are interested in analysing fan fiction, then get yourself along to this meetup. Arrive at 6pm for a 6:30pm start!</p> <p>NOTE: The room is G13 not G14 (meetup won't allow adding G13 as a new location).</p> <p>#Presenter<br/>Liza Bolton is a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Auckland. Sometimes she is also an introductory stats lecturer and other times she is a Data Ambassador (www.dataembassy.co.nz), which is really just a more fun way of saying ""statistical consultant"". While having 2000 students do Harry Potter Fanfiction exam questions may be Liza's greatest life achievement, her second is, possibly, designing stats t-shirts that people have actually purchased. Make her day by following her on Twitter at @Liza_Bolton.</p> <p>#Abstract<br/>This workshop will introduce web scraping in R through the rvest package, as well as some basics of ethics/things to check before scraping, and basic ideas regarding URLs, HTML and CSS. The example will be based on scraping Harry Potter fanfiction because that was how this all started for Liza - needing a dataset to write a statistics exam for her students. Bringing along a computer with R installed is recommended, though you are still totally welcome to come without one.</p> "

R-Ladies Vienna,Joint Event: Women in Tech Initiatives Meetup @PyDays,2019-05-03,16:00,3,"<p>Technologists create products and services and in doing so affect our everyday lives now and in the future. If these products and services are supposed to serve our society as a whole, we need a lot of diverse and creative perspectives reflecting the richness of our communities. Therefore, we strongly believe that striving to increase diversity among technologists should be a major goal.</p> <p>On our pursuit for diversity, one of the most encouraging things we can do is to highlight those women who already work on great things within their respective industries, provide them platforms to share their knowledge and inspire by their example.</p> <p>In Vienna, a range of initiatives promoting gender diversity in STEM (science, technology, engineering &amp; math) exist. To increase visibility as well as to facilitate exchange of ideas and getting-to-know-each-other amongst these initiatives, a session solely dedicated to these groups and projects will take place during PyDays Vienna (<a href=""https://www.pydays.at"" class=""linkified"">https://www.pydays.at</a>)</p> <p>Enlisted Initiatives:<br/>- Co-Mentoring Programme - Women in Data Science<br/>- Feminist Python Meetup for Women* and Non-Binary Folks in Vienna<br/>- Feminist Linux Meetup für Frauen*, Non-Binary*, Trans* und Inter* Personen<br/>- diebin.at - Verein zur Förderung emanzipatorischer Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien<br/>- R-Ladies Vienna<br/>- IEEE Women in Engineering</p> <p>People of all genders are welcome to attend our event.<br/>Find out more at: <a href=""https://www.pydays.at/womenintech/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.pydays.at/womenintech/</a></p> "

Join us to learn more about Shiny apps!  </p> <p><b>Get materials here:</b></p> <p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o5zgygc5aoor36z/AABI0oDi8ObIa18cziV5-Q4sa?dl=0""><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o5zgygc5aoor36z/AABI0oDi8ObIa18cziV5-Q4sa?dl=0"" class=""linkified"">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o5zgygc5aoor36z/AABI0oDi8ObIa18cziV5-Q4sa?dl=0</a></a></p> <p>With the use of the Shiny package for the R programming language, users are able to make interactive web applications that can be a powerful tool for sharing and communication of research. The package provides tools for shaping a user-interface and providing reactive elements dependent on user input. This is all achieved while maintaining the functionality and flexibility of R. This 2 hour workshop will serve as an introduction to the Shiny framework, demonstrating some of its uses. It will include hands-on coding, so feel free to bring a charged laptop with R and RStudio installed. </p> "

But if things don't work and you're having issues, don't worry! We're here to help (◕‿◕✿)</p> <p>About this meetup:</p> <p>Using Shiny in consulting can be challenging, as all deployment options involve either sending intellectual property and data to the cloud or IT involvement. When providing consultative like services to extremely large, risk-averse, enterprises this can greatly restrict one’s ability to quickly get Shiny apps into users’ hands, as engagement of IT can take months if approved at all. We’ll share how the Columbus Collaboratory team overcame these barriers to rapid deployment by coupling R Portable and Electron, a framework for creating native applications with a variety of web technologies. All the tools needed to use Electron for desktop deployment of Shiny apps will be reviewed. We’ll highlight a specific example in which these technologies were used within a large enterprise to completely automate a weekly report. We’ll also share how the app used R Packages such as openxlsx, shinydashboard, RODBC, and Zoo to query an internal database, cleanse data, calculate key metrics, and create a downloadable excel file for dissemination. The best part? This Shiny app was delivered to the end business user as a stand-alone executable.</p> <p>Parking: Park in any spot marked ""Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory"".

RLadies Columbus has got you covered. At this meet up I (Katie) am going to share some of the ""best"" content from useR. We will cover several of the session talks and a few of the paid tutorials at a super high-level; with my goal being at the end to take a vote of attendees and pick one of the topics to dive deeper on at an upcoming RLadies. I hope to cover (~5 mins each) most of the following: gganimate package and keynote talk, glue package and talk, Roger Peng Beyond Syntax keynote talk, Fable and Fasster forecasting packages and talks, SEER package and talk, Jenny Bryan's Code Smells and Feels talk and key functions learned, MGCV/Beyond Linearity tutorial and content, Max Kuhn recipes package tutorial and content. Goal is to give attendees enough info such that they could go home, watch talk, and walk through any associated materials and tutorials on their own. Other goal: choose one of the packages associated with a talk or tutorial to dive deeper on together at a future RLadies.</p> "

In this talk, I will discuss why I was originally hesitant to contribute to open source, but how the R community made me realise my doubts were unfounded. I'll walk you through the stages of making a pull request to a tidyverse package and discuss my experiences of doing so. Whilst the focus of this talk is on contributing code, I conclude with the other valuable ways you can get involved, whether you've been using R for 2 weeks or 20 years.

R-Ladies Gainesville,November R-Ladies meeting: Technology and the Data Revolution Discussion,2018-11-26,18:00,10,"<p>Technology and the Data Revolution Discussion, led by Dr Morgan Ernest.<br/>Dr Ernest is a professor at the University of Florida at Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. Her lab is part of the ""weecology"" group, an interdisciplinary ecology research group (<a href=""https://www.weecology.org/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.weecology.org/</a>).<br/>For R-Ladies, she will lead a discussion on how different types of technology are changing the amount of data we have, how we collect it and the challenges these different data types present for analysis/management, etc. This promises to be an interesting discussion considering all our different backgrounds!</p> <p>If time (and attendance) allows, we also want to do ""speed discussions"" in small groups, along the lines of speed dating. The idea is that within a set amount of time people talk to each other in small groups or one-on-one about their interests, how they use data and how they use R. When time is up, we change groups. We think this will be a fun way to get to know each other better, and learn more about what's possible in data science and R!</p> <p>NB We get a $0.50 discount on beers! Meeting will be in the Brick Room. As usual, opportunity to socialize afterwards, and kids are welcome!<br/>Sorry - as far as we're aware there will not be a food truck that evening.</p> "

He is interested in building tools (computational and cognitive) that make data ingest, preparation, manipulation, visualization and analysis easier. He's developed over 30 R packages, for data analysis (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr), making frustrating parts of R easier to use (lubridate for dates, stringr for strings, httr for accessing web APIs), and for streamlining the R package development (devtools, roxygen2, and testthat).</p> <p>SUMMARY: Dr. Wickham will discuss the benefits for reproducibility on the small scale (e.g. a single scientific paper) which are clear: anything that can be reified and made explicit in code, should be made explicit in code. In this talk, he'll discuss how reproducibility has escaped journal articles in his life and influences almost everything he does. He'll discuss three unexpected venues of reproducibility in his life:</p> <p>1. “Writing reproducible books with bookdown, which allows me to generate html, pdf, and epub versions of the text with a press of a key.”<br/>2. “Writing reproducible blog posts with blogdown, which makes easy to intermingle code and prose in low-stakes explanations of my work.”<br/>3. “Generating reproducible emails to track shared water usage and inform my neighbours when they owe me money!”</p> <p>He'll also touch on the intersection of reproducibility and software development, highlighting best practices like unit testing, code coverage, and continuous integration.</p> <p>Directions/Parking: see details at <a href=""https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/HadleyWickham_Oct2018/"" class=""linkified"">https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/HadleyWickham_Oct2018/</a></p> <p>REGISTER AT THIS LINK ONLY <a href=""https://eventactions.com/eareg.aspx?ea=Rsvp&amp;invite=gwump82y45b2ccrggusxhyp5gcm5v88cn8hdhgkyc4wd1e7whw45"" class=""linkified"">https://eventactions.com/eareg.aspx?ea=Rsvp&amp;invite=gwump82y45b2ccrggusxhyp5gcm5v88cn8hdhgkyc4wd1e7whw45</a></p> "

R-Ladies Oslo,Bayesian methods for rank and preference data with Valeria Vitelli,2019-03-18,17:00,36,"<p>Bayesian methods for rank and preference data - from recommendation systems to cancer genomics</p> <p>Ranking items is crucial for collecting information about preferences in many areas, from marketing to politics. The interest often lies both in producing estimates of the consensus ranking of the items, which is shared among users, and in learning individualized preferences of the users, useful for providing personalized recommendations. In the latter task it is particularly relevant to have posterior distributions of individual rankings, since these can provide an evaluation of the uncertainty associated to the estimates, and thus they can avoid unnecessarily spamming the users.</p> <p>I will present a statistical model which works well in these situations, and which is able of flexibly handling quite different kind of data. The Bayesian paradigm allows a fully probabilistic analysis, and it easily handles missing data and cluster estimation via augmentation procedures.<br/>Interestingly, this Bayesian framework has also proved to be useful for genomic data integration, since typically heterogeneous microarray data are available from different sources, and their combination allows both to gain statistical power and to strengthen the biological insight.</p> <p>Valeria Vitelli holds a PhD in statistics from Politecnico di Milano, Italy. She was a postdoc at Ecole Centrale Paris for a year, within a research group funded by Eléctricité de France working on big data problems in the energy sector. She then moved to the University of Oslo, where after a 5 years postdoc period funded from the Norwegian Cancer Society she became associate professor in September 2018. Her experience spans over several areas of mathematics and statistics, including functional data analysis with applications in physiology, machine learning (describing people mobility in dense urbanized areas from mobile phone data), and finally statistical genomics of cancer.</p> "

However, the often-heard complaint is that R can be very slow, especially when using for-loops. During this workshop we will first look at ways to find out which part of our script is slow. We next try simple tricks to speed up our R code, and we will discuss how to avoid for-loops (or keep them, but run them in another language).

R-Ladies Sydney,R-Ladies Sydney launch--- Lightning talks,2018-06-20,18:30,79,"<p>We are super excited to announce that R-Ladies Sydney will launch on June 20th 2018. For our first event, we want everyone to meet someone new and learn something new so we plan to host a series of lightning talks. You are all invited to participate! Lightning talks are only 5-6 min long and can be about anything. You could talk about…</p> <p>Here is a cool R related thing you might not know about<br/>My favourite R package<br/>I use R in my work because...<br/>The most useful/fun thing I have learned in R recently<br/>My favourite R learning resource is…<br/>Why I ditched excel and learned R (and changed my life forever)</p> <p>… you get the idea. Talks will be informal; slides are optional. We encourage participation from everyone (beginners through experts; people who speak about R all the time and those don’t love to speak in public about anything).</p> <p>Let us know that you would like to present by completing this form.</p> <p><a href=""https://goo.gl/forms/3FAwRLqtNS0ENICy2"" class=""linkified"">https://goo.gl/forms/3FAwRLqtNS0ENICy2</a></p> <p>Doors will open at 6:30pm for a 7pm start. Babes in arms welcome.</p> <p>We also encourage you all to read (and contribute to) the R-Ladies Sydney blog- <a href=""https://rladiessydney.org/"" class=""linkified"">https://rladiessydney.org/</a>. We want to make the blog a space where everyone can share ideas so even R-Ladies who are unable to attend the meetup can benefit from the group. With this in mind, it would be great if talk presenters would be willing to contribute to the blog. In addition, if the idea of a lightning talk terrifies you, but writing a blog about your R journey doesn't sound awful, we would love to hear from you.</p> <p>Check out this post by Dani (<a href=""https://rladiessydney.org/posts/contribute-a-post/"" class=""linkified"">https://rladiessydney.org/posts/contribute-a-post/</a>) re how to contribute. Feel free to tweet us, or email [masked] with your blog ideas.</p> <p>We look forward to meeting you on the 20th!</p> "
R-Ladies Sydney,R-Curious?,2018-06-21,13:00,34,"<p>Are you R Curious?</p> <p>Been meaning to quit excel and learn R for ages but not managed to find the time? Or maybe you are just not quite sure what this R thing that everyone is talking about is? This is the workshop for you.</p> <p>You have probably had someone say, “It’s easy to use R. Just type R.” Or “Oh, I just use the lm() function.” and thought, huh? Sometimes R users can trivialise the process of getting started.</p> <p>In this workshop, we aim to equip new R users with the confidence to problem-solve their way through getting set up with R and RStudio, and importing and exploring data in R. Developed through discussions amongst RLadies who also teach and communicate, we aim to visit the biggest potential pitfalls of your first data analysis in R. From installation issues with packages, to different data structures, to beginning exploratory data analysis and visualisation in R.</p> <p>Charles T. Gray is a tidyvert, PhD (meta-analysis) student at La Trobe, and reformed musician. She is a member of R-Ladies Remote and is known for her math advocacy work as a Mathbassador for Choose Maths <a href=""http://choosemaths.org.au/charles-gray/"" class=""linkified"">http://choosemaths.org.au/charles-gray/</a></p> <p>She is presenting the R-Curious workshop as an RLadies event at useR! 2018 conference in Brisbane in July (<a href=""https://user2018.r-project.org/rcurious/"" class=""linkified"">https://user2018.r-project.org/rcurious/</a>) and when she RSVPed for the Sydney launch we jumped at the chance to have her do a dry run here in Sydney.</p> <p>This is a hands on workshop and space is STRICTLY limited. RSVP asap.</p> <p>No pressure, but if you have a chance, we’d appreciate it if you had a go at getting set up in advance.</p> <p><a href=""https://github.com/softloud/rcurious/blob/master/explore/onboarding.Rmd"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/softloud/rcurious/blob/master/explore/onboarding.Rmd</a></p> <p>Don’t worry if you try and it gets frustrating; there is no shame in choosing to ragequit (an important sanity-preserving technique worth cultivating). We will cover installation as part of the workshop, but if some of you are set up, then you can help others around you.</p> <p>This RLadies-Sydney workshop is proudly sponsored by the University of Sydney School of Mathematics &amp; Statistics and the University of New South Wales School of Psychology.</p> "
R-Ladies Sydney,Tidyverse for beginners (BYO data),2018-08-22,18:00,56,"<p>Yikes- where did July go? We have Shiny and machine learning and other fun things planned for later in the year, but lets squeeze in a beginners event before August disappears too. The remarkable Dani Navarro (<a href=""https://twitter.com/djnavarro"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/djnavarro</a>) is going to run a tidyverse event on Aug 22nd.</p> <p>Dani is a computational cognitive scientist at UNSW who uses R in her research and teaching. She is the author of ""Learning statistics with R"", a free online text book that you can access here: <a href=""https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/"" class=""linkified"">https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/</a>.</p> <p>She is the kind of R user who can fill in as a keynote speaker at userR at the last minute and totally ace it. Check out her talk here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFkEbYk0C0Q"" class=""embedded"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFkEbYk0C0Q</a>.</p> <p>### Who is this for?</p> <p>Are you new to this R business and short on time? Would you like to start working with data in R without having to go through the arduous process of learning all the programming details first? Do you have a neat data set you'd like to explore and visualise? This might be the workshop for you!</p> <p>Or are you an experienced old school R programmer who learned how to do everything in base R? Are you secretly nervous around pipes? Do you sometimees wonder whether the tibble is worth the trouble? Then this might be for you too!</p> <p>### Cool... what's the plan?</p> <p>The idea is for everyone to bring a data set of their own, and to work together as a group to explore the data sets using tidyverse. We'll cover:</p> <p>- The basic mechanics of tidyverse<br/>- Exploring data with `dplyr`: `summarise` variables, `group_by` to split by groups, `filter` the cases you're interested in, `select` variables that matter, `arrange` data into a format you want, using `mutate` to transform variables<br/>- Visualising data with `ggplot2`: histograms, scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, plots with error bars, breaking down plots separately by group, customising your plot to make it preeeettty.</p> <p>Depending on need (and time!!) we might cover some of the annoying data wrangling jobs like how to use `gather` and `spread` to switch between ""wide"" and ""long"" form data with only a modest amount of pain!</p> <p>The workshop will follow the directions that participants want to go with the data, but is loosely based on the working with data section to Dani's ""R for Psychological Science"" notes: e.g.</p> <p><a href=""http://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/visualising-data.html"" class=""linkified"">http://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/visualising-data.html</a></p> <p>### Awesome! What do I need to bring?</p> <p>- A laptop with R and RStudio installed (ideally - if you don't already have R on your machine, it's probbably a good idea to show up a little early...)</p> <p>- A data set saved as a CSV file (ideally - if you have data in Excel or SPSS we can work with that too, but also worth arriving a little early)</p> <p>- That's it!</p> "

R-Ladies Sydney,Machine Learning 101 in R (Part 1),2018-10-10,18:00,38,"<p>Hello there Sydney R-Ladies!</p> <p>Have you always been interested in machine learning in R, but haven't had a chance to learn the lingo and get started? This month we're in luck because Sarah Romanes (@sarah_romanes) will be giving us a introduction to the topic!</p> <p>This Meetup will be the first stage of a two-part workshop, and is appropriate for beginners. It assumes a familiarity with R, but doesn't assume you have any previous experience with machine learning or statistical modelling. The format for this part will be mostly be an introductory talk (part 2 is likely to have more hands on content).</p> <p>The topics covered are:</p> <p>- What is machine learning?<br/>- Introduction to linear regression<br/>- Introduction to generalised linear models<br/>- Building classifiers using k-nearest neighbours<br/>- Decision trees<br/>- Introduction to ensemble learning (with random forests)</p> <p>Bring your fully charged laptop (the space is short on powerpoints), with R and RStudio installed.</p> "
R-Ladies Sydney,Machine Learning 101 in R (Part 2),2018-10-17,18:00,38,"<p>See Machine Learning isn't as scary as you thought right?</p> <p>In Part 2, the focus will be a little more hands on than Part 1. The specifics of the workshop are still being finalised (watch this space!) but will include topics like fitting models using cross-validation and covers the use of the caret package in R.</p> <p>Bring your fully charged laptop (the space is short on powerpoints), with R and RStudio installed.</p> "

R-Ladies Sydney,Bayesian inference with RStan ,2019-02-24,12:00,33,"<p>LINK TO PRE WORKSHOP INSTRUCTIONS/WHERE TO GO HERE</p> <p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlFf8TJq-BqYxUmWf2G9LGBHOHJOU4zsTUWCkI4m3hE/edit?usp=sharing"" class=""linkified"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlFf8TJq-BqYxUmWf2G9LGBHOHJOU4zsTUWCkI4m3hE/edit?usp=sharing</a></p> <p>STOP THE PRESS!</p> <p>Michael Betancourt is visiting Sydney and has offered to run a Stan workshop for us… eeeeep!! We couldn’t turn down this opportunity.</p> <p>How do we learn effectively from data? As scientists, engineers and analysts, this is a constant refrain. One answer to this question has traditionally been ""just use big data sets"", yet this is not always practical nor even relevant. In real life, our statistical inferences are restricted not because we have too little data but because we ignore the systematic structure of our data. Only by carefully modelling this structure can we take fully advantage of the data - big or small - available to us.</p> <p>In this course we provide an introduction to the basics of Bayesian inference, and the Stan software used to implement Bayesian methods. The power of this approach lies in the flexibility of Stan - it provides a an expressive modelling language for specifying customised, bespoke models and implementing state-of-the-art algorithms to draw subsequent Bayesian inferences. As an R-Ladies event, the workshop runs through interactive exercises run with RStan, the R interface to Stan.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <p>This event is best geared for intermediate/advanced R users. We assume you are interested in Bayesian statistics and are familiar with the basics of calculus and linear algebra. Conceptual understanding of probability theory and conditional probability will be useful; check out content on Michael Betancourt's website.</p> <p><a href=""https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html"" class=""linkified"">https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/conditional_probability_theory.html"" class=""linkified"">https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/conditional_probability_theory.html</a></p> <p>In order to participate in the interactive exercises attendees must bring a laptop with R and the latest version of RStan installed (<a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html"" class=""linkified"">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html</a>).</p> <p>Please verify that you can run the 8schools model as discussed in the RStan Quick Start Guide (<a href=""https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started</a>) and report any installation issues on the Stan Forums (<a href=""https://discourse.mc-stan.org"" class=""linkified"">https://discourse.mc-stan.org</a>) as early as possible.</p> <p>For beginners who need help with the above, there will be a pre-Stan Hacky Hour the week before the event.</p> <p>Bring your lunch on Sunday, we will kick off around 12:30 and aim to be done by 5:30pm.</p> "
R-Ladies Sydney,RMarkdown Throwdown,2019-02-27,18:00,42,"<p>RMarkdown is becoming THE way to create reproducible reports of analyses carried out in R. As if RMarkdown weren’t great enough for that purpose, there is also a veritable feast of markdown-related packages that can be used to create everything from blogs, books, and posters, to slides, CVs, and interactive dashboards.</p> <p>At Markdown Throwdown, you’ll hear short talks showcasing the power of RMarkdown. Maybe your RMarkdown experience is as limited as ""I know how to knit a document into an html report"". Or maybe you have played around with blogdown, radix, pagedown, bookdown, thesisdown, rticles, vitae, papaja, flexdashboard, learnr, tufte, remedy, namer, or xarigan (see! it IS a feast!). Perhaps you don’t even know what Markdown is! No matter what, we guarantee you’ll learn something at our Markdown Throwdown!</p> <p>You might also guess what that means! We’re looking for Throwdown participants (read: presenters; trust us, this is not as scary as it sounds!). This is an opportunity to demo your RMarkdown skills for the audience, showcasing something amazing that can be done in RMarkdown. No skill is ‘too limited’ - even experienced data scientists who use R every day might not know anything about Markdown! So if you’re at all inclined to present, go for it!</p> <p>Interested in presenting?

R-Ladies Helsinki,Planning meeting,2018-10-23,17:30,8,<p>Gathering to plan the actual kick-off meetup and the future events.</p> 
R-Ladies Helsinki,R-Ladies Helsinki Kickoff!,2018-12-11,18:00,26,<p>What is R? What is R-Ladies? How to use R in practice? Welcome to the first ever R-Ladies Helsinki Meet-up to hear about these topics and mingle with fellow enthusiasts.</p> <p>Schedule<br/>18.00 Welcome<br/>18.10 Intro to R-Ladies and community<br/>18.30 Data Science &amp; R in Omnichannel customer experience creation<br/>19.15 Introducing and discussing the future of R-Ladies Helsinki and program<br/>19.30 Networking</p> 
R-Ladies Helsinki,DevOps for Data Science,2019-01-22,18:00,27,"<p>DevOps for Data Science or<br/>How to build a data pipeline that is not a giant house of cards built from random scripts that will all completely collapse the moment any input does anything weird (see <a href=""https://xkcd.com/2054/"" class=""linkified"">https://xkcd.com/2054/</a>)</p> <p>We’ve all heard the saying about the 80-20 rule in data science, that most of the project time is spent on wrangling the data in to correct format and only a fraction on the actual model building. The truth is actually even worse: there’s also the effort needed to make sure your model will not explode when left to run on its own in production – or to make sure you will notice when it does.</p> <p>That’s where DevOps comes in. In this talk Seija Sirkiä will introduce basic concepts like version control and CI/CD (continuous integration, continuous development) and attempt to do this from the perspective and to an audience of data scientists (maybe particularly those who use R and RStudio). This is not a lesson in exact tools but more a plea for a change in attitude. It is true that we are not software engineers and we don’t exactly produce software but a big part of our daily troubles are the same.</p> <p>Program:<br/>18.00 Welcome !<br/>18.10 Seija Sirkiä and DevOps for Data Science<br/>19.10 Mingle and questions<br/>20.00 Closing the event</p> <p>Place: Houston Analytics, Konepajankuja 1</p> "
R-Ladies Helsinki,Genomic data science,2019-03-14,18:00,23,"<p>Where did my ancestors live? What is my risk for coronary heart disease? Genomic data science involves analysing and interpreting the information in genome sequences by applying statistics and computer science. Genomics plays an important role in many endeavors towards personalized medicine and although consumer DNA testing is becoming a mainstream phenomenon, many questions still need to be answered before genome data can be widely applied in clinical care. Genomics produces huge volumes of data, and this meeting will dive into the different aspects and challenges of analysing it.</p> <p>Program:<br/>18.00 Welcome<br/>18.10 Nina Mars, Genomic data science<br/>19.10 Questions and mingle<br/>20.00 Closing the event</p> "
R-Ladies Helsinki,Writing sharable (R) code. Oh… and sharing it!,2019-04-04,18:00,22,"<p>Join this session where we will build an R package, write unit tests for it, push it in a GitHub repository and integrate Travis CI with it!<br/>If time permits, we can discuss briefly at the end how to build a drat repository — aimed to host multiple R packages — using GitHub as a Web Server, and how to use Travis CI to automatically push updates of your packages into the drat repo.</p> <p>If you have never created an R package before, you may feel like this is too much information in a just short while. But don’t let this overwhelm you! The aim of this session is to introduce you to the relevant concepts, as we will touch upon the most important of them rather than diving into details. Even if you don’t fully understand what you are doing during the session, you will hopefully leave with a different perspective on how you can organise your code (for yourself or others) and gear up with the needed resources for the next time you want to reproduce these steps more seriously.</p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>- Bring your own laptop!<br/>- (Optional) Rstudio installed; this is not necessary to produce R packages but it does make your life easier as the main package for R package development, devtools, is well integrated with RStudio.<br/>- The following R packages:<br/>- devtools, usethis and roxygen2<br/>- tidyverse, rlang<br/>- (optional) drat<br/>- ... if I have forgotten something, we will install it on the spot.<br/>- A GitHub account. I could list this also as optional, but if you want the full experience from this second half of the session, it’s good to reproduce the steps yourself. You are of course welcome either way.<br/>- A travis account (go to travis-ci.com and sign up with GitHub; this prerequisite assumes you already have a GitHub account)</p> <p>Program:<br/>18.00 Welcome<br/>18.10 Maria Kalimeri, ""Writing sharable R code.""<br/>19.30 Questions and mingle<br/>20.00 Closing the event</p> "

R-Ladies Dallas,Filling your data science backpack: applying statistical models to data with R,2018-05-05,12:00,17,"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Finding your bearings in data science can be difficult. Often it feels like you've been dropped in the wilderness and are just trying to survive with the contents of your backpack - and you packed all the wrong things.</p> <p>Our goal as RLadies Dallas is to start helping members fill their ""data science backpack"" with the skills and content knowledge needed to not only survive as data scientists (who use R), but to thrive as data scientists, no matter the environment.</p> <p>This will be a collaborative workshop where we outline the data science workflow and practice moving through the workflow using our own data sets and the tidyverse, with a particular focus on applying statistical models to a data set.</p> <p>Members are encouraged to have read through ""OpenIntro Statistics"" up to the point that they feel comfortable. That might be the whole text for some members, or half of chapter one for others. There's no judgement or expectation, we just ask that you do your best!</p> <p>For those comfortable with the majority of the contents, you will be expected to take on leadership roles and mentor those still learning, while those learning should come prepared to ask questions. It's entirely possible that you're a mentor for some chapters, and a learner in others, and that's awesome! The goal is for both learners and mentors to develop a deeper understanding of statistical models and how to apply them to data sets that we use in our research, jobs, and/or hobbies.</p> <p>*** please note *** we will be discussing whether or not the ""OpenIntro Statistics"" text is the text we'd like to use for this meetup in our Slack group. If we choose a different text, this posting will be updated to reflect that.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>A laptop that can connect to the internet<br/>A data set to work on (if you have one - if not, we will provide examples you can use)<br/>Any food or drinks for personal consumption<br/>Clothing layers - the temperature in the space can fluctuate</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>OpenIntro Statistics is available for free online here: <a href=""https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os"" class=""linkified"">https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os</a></p> <p>If you need assistance setting up Slack, installing R, installing RStudio or finding a dataset, please email dallas [at] rladies [dot] org and we'll get you squared away!</p> <p>We know that not everyone lives close by - please coordinate rideshares in our #rideshares channel in Slack.

R-Ladies Munich,5 - SpeakeRs Unite! - Round 1,2018-03-09,19:00,19,"<p>• What we'll do<br/>As said before, we are kick-starting this year with a series of talks in which fellow R-Ladies members have the chance to share with us what they are doing with R. And this time, we're all about Building R packages.</p> <p>We are really happy to announce our first round of speakers from the R-Ladies community:</p> <p>1: Beibei Jiang's ""SimPhe"".<br/>Beibei is a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich. She developed a package called SimPhe (available on CRAN) to simulate phenotypes with epistatic interactions, and presented it at a lightning talk at useR!2017 in Brussels.</p> <p>2: Sophie Molnos' ""pulver"".<br/>She studied Bioinformatics in Berlin and I did her PhD at the Helmholtz Center Munich. She is now working in the field of Genetic Epidemiology, analyzing mitochondrial DNA and its association with human traits. She developed a package called ""pulver"" to handle significant interaction terms from linear regression models based on big data. Having had these experiences, they will share some insights on building R packages.</p> <p>Save the date, as further speakers for this session might be coming up soon!</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Something to take notes with - everything else will be(er) provided. (See what we did there?)</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This event is NOT exclusively for women, but in case we run out of places, they would be preferentially assigned. So feel free to join and bring friends along!</p> "
R-Ladies Munich,6 - RLadies Stammtisch ,2018-04-06,18:30,8,"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Time to relax, get a drink and just get to know each other. What is the use of being part of such a cool organization if we do not really know what everyone is up to? This is the perfect occasion to sit back, take a sip of your favorite beer/soft drink and talk about how shared love for R - kidding, we do love R, but we're excited to have some off-time to actually talk and network. Of course, feel free to bring your friends/work colleagues/R-interested-neighbors (could happen,just saying) - a ton of experience with R is by no means a requirement to join this Stammtisch. Also, if this would be your first time attending an R-Ladies event, that's great! We're looking forward to seeing new faces :)</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>RSVP necessary!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>As we will be meeting in a restaurant, we will do a reservation for 20 people.</p> <p>Please RSVP as soon as you know if you're joining, first-come-first-served sort of. If you already RSVPed and for some reason won't be able to attend, cancel your participation and let someone else take your spot (we'll be taking names and setting up a waiting list).</p> "

R-Ladies Chicago,R-Ladies Chicago welcomes Mara Averick: Sustainers of the Tidyverse,2019-03-26,18:00,71,"<p>Join us in welcoming tidyverse developer advocate and Twitter #rstats star Mara Averick!</p> <p>• What we'll do:</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>5:45-6 -- R tour for beginners; sign up here: <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/rladiestour"" class=""linkified"">https://tinyurl.com/rladiestour</a><br/>6-6:30 -- Food, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>6:30-7:10 -- Talk by Mara<br/>7:10-8:00 -- Socializing/Networking/Hanging out</p> <p>Bio: Mara Averick is the tidyverse developer advocate at RStudio. She got into R by way of a long-time love for the NBA and (fantasy) basketball. When not catering to the every whim of her dogs, she can be found: perusing weird words; indulging her bibliomania; and/or watching, quantifying, and visualizing Archer.</p> <p>Topic: Sustainers of the Tidyverse<br/>Abstract: If a piece of open-source software is to survive its own success, it must have a healthy community of active contributors. The tidyverse, a collection of R packages for data science with a shared underlying design philosophy, has become popular in no small part because of its usability among those who do not consider themselves to be “programmers.” However, this active base of non-developer users has been a fruitful source of contributions as we’ve sought to highlight aspects of contributing to open source beyond committing lines of code. This talk will cover the technical tools, virtual spaces, and social norms that have enabled and empowered community contributions.</p> <p>Find Mara on Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/dataandme"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/dataandme</a></p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor, as spots may be limited.

R-Ladies Leuven,R-Ladies Leuven March Meetup,2018-03-28,18:00,12,"<p>• What we'll do:<br/>-First, Lisa Röttjers (<a href=""https://be.linkedin.com/in/lisarottjers"" class=""linkified"">https://be.linkedin.com/in/lisarottjers</a>) will provide some theoretical background on different Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN, logistic regression and random forest, and then use those algorithms to identify risk factors for cervical cancer (<a href=""https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29"" class=""linkified"">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29</a>).</p> <p>-Next, Jessa Bekker (<a href=""https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jessa.bekker/"" class=""linkified"">https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jessa.bekker/</a>) will introduce her work in learning from positive and unlabelled data. This is a special type of data the occurs often in practice. Tradition machine learning requires ""fully supervised data"" which is ""positive and negative data"", i.e., each example in the dataset has a label that is either positive or negative. In practice however, labels are often not available and the labels that we do have are all positive. Where does this data occur and what makes it challenging? How can we deal with this kind of data?</p> <p>-Then, Lisa will follow on the previous talk. She will process the cervical cancer dataset to “unlabel” some of the data and see how that affects tool performance.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>A laptop with R and R-studio installed, if you wish to follow the hands-on.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Hello R-Ladies!

R-Ladies Manchester,fundamental concepts of R & reproducible R Markdown documents,2016-12-14,17:00,15,"<p><b>R-Ladies Manchester</b> is ready to announce our first event! </p> <p>R-Ladies Manchester is part of a global initiative, R-Ladies Global, designed to improve the gender diversity of R users worldwide and in particular, to improve the participation and experience of women in the R community. As part of the initiative, R-Ladies Manchester will host a number of talks and workshops about the use of R. It doesn't matter if you never used R or if you are an R expert, R-Ladies Manchester welcomes anyone with an interest in R. The goal is to promote R, exchange knowledge and create an R community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as female who is interested in and/or working with R.</p> <p>We will begin our first workshop by reinforcing the foundations of your data analysis knowledge and R skills, and then move on to creating reproducible reports using R Markdown. The workshop starts with some warm-ups to get your brain in R-mode, and to make sure the basics are covered. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises, you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R: basic use of the R/RStudio console, inputting and importing different data types, record keeping, graphs etc. It concludes by showing how to create reproducible R Markdown documents. You might wish to bring your own laptop!  </p> <p>To gain an insight in the members’ competence and interest in R, we kindly ask you to answer our short <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10yy1MouWOCpvrBdygFZZFwg8MoS4xwkLtPeXoGjuNw0/edit?c=0&amp;w=1"">survey</a> and to spread the word about our group.</p> <p>We are on Tweeter: @RLadiesManchest and on GitHab: RLadiesManchester</p> <p>We hope you will join us!</p> "

The first time Daryn gave this talk back in summer 2017, she walked us through considerations for using R as an SPSS user from the perspective of a relatively new R user (as she was at the time!). She has since updated the presentation and will be leading it anew on Thursday, November 29th at 6pm. The workshop will involve learning how to think about your data in R as an SPSS user and to use commands for running statistical tests in both programs. She will also walk us through how to manipulate your data in R and output it in a ready-for-SPSS format for those who don't like data wrangling in Excel, but work with supervisors or colleagues who prefer to work with SPSS. Daryn is also a tidyverse fiend, and has a way of sprinkling helpful nuggets of useful tidy syntax throughout. Bottom line: there will be lots to learn, whether you're an SPSS user or not!</p> "

R-Ladies Boston,dplyr 0.7.0 - tidyeval / programming with dplyr,2017-08-17,18:00,24,"<p>Dplyr is a super popular R package that is great for exploration and transformation of tabular data (think data frames), is awesomely readable, and is perfect for beginners to get productive fast. Unfortunately, some of the things that make it great for productivity and interactivity make it less great for programming - i.e. using variables to make code more flexible and reusable. This major release of dplyr has some updates that begin to address these issues. </p> <p>I will give a speedy intro to dplyr then we'll go through some of the new goodies! There will be pizza!</p> <p>NOTE: This venue requires full names for visitors a few days in advance. Contact me through the link on the left if this poses an issue.</p> "

R-Ladies Boston,October Meetup & Pre-EARL Boston social event,2017-11-01,18:00,11,"<p><b>NOTE DATE CHANGE:</b> Hi all! I was feeling silly for misreading the calendar and scheduling this a day too early for EARL arrivals not taking workshops, but am now MORTIFIED (MORTIFIED!) that it didn't occur to me that the whole Halloween thing would affect people with children. I am so sorry everyone, carer duties, even fun ones, are among the reasons that women often have less time to advance their careers! <b>To those who have already RSVP'd yes: if desired, I will still have a beer/beverage with you, on the 31st, or another date!</b></p> <p>October's meetup will be a SOCIAL one, which we haven't had for a few months!

R-Ladies Boston,Writing reports with knitr,2017-11-15,18:00,13,"<p>I just taught a workshop at Penn that ended with knitr and all the feedback was ""we want more knitr!"" so I'm expanding it for the Boston crowd. The target audience for the seminar section is more toward beginners who have not experimented with knitr, but I hope folks who already use it might learn a trick or a better way to do something, either from me or another attendee.</p> <p>We'll go over the anatomy of a knitr report (YAML header, Markdown, chunks, output options) and I'll demo a few reports - a very simple one and an envelope-pushing one.</p> <p>I intend to leave time at the end for folks to work on a knitr project in a friendly &amp; knowledgeable environment.

R-Ladies Boston,purrr with Phoebe Wong,2018-01-23,18:00,21,"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Phoebe will walk through the purrr package, a complete and consistent functional programming toolkit for R. It will be a hands-on workshop focusing on map() functions that help to perform iterative tasks with more readable code. It is especially helpful when working with nested list, for example, JSON objects, a common data format from web scraping outputs and databases.</p> <p>The workshop is designed to be beginner friendly that no prior experience with purrr is required. However, some experience with data manipulation in lists and data frames in R will be helpful to understand the content. We recommend you to bring your personal laptop with R and RStudio installed, however, it is not a requirement. More setup details to follow closer to the date.</p> <p>About the speaker</p> <p>Phoebe Wong is a research analyst in the analytics group of a Hollywood movie production company. She uses R at her day job, while outside of work, she uses R to wrangle interesting public data and build Shiny applications.

R-Ladies Boston,Channeling Curiosity into R Data Visualization Projects - with Alex Albright,2018-02-20,18:00,40,"<p>• What we'll do<br/>How can R users learn to visualize data? While there are many incredible courses and resources, nothing is as effective as finding an intriguing question and challenging oneself to create an original visual answer. Generating visualizations can be astonishingly satisfying and can drive deep dives into R workflow, libraries, and community resources. I will present snippets of scripts and notebooks written to visually answer the following questions, running the gamut from quirky and light to serious and weighty: How often do female athletes grace the cover of Sports Illustrated? How have demographics changed in the sciences? How have Pixar movie ratings changed over time? How did US Senators vote on healthcare repeal? Which characters are closest on the TV show ‘Friends’?</p> <p>Presenter Bio:<br/>Alex Albright is a PhD student in economics at Harvard University. An aspiring labor and behavioral economist, Alex is passionate about making empirical academic work reproducible and accessible. Her usage of R stems from a desire to use tools that are freely available and open source. She is an enthusiastic user of the ggplot2 package for visually communicating her explorations of a wide variety of datasets. She engages with general audiences outside of academia by writing about economics and data-driven questions at her blog, The Little Dataset (<a href=""https://thelittledataset.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://thelittledataset.com/</a>)</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> "

Bring your problems, bring your successes, bring your almost-theres. There will be a 10-15 minute talk about using tidyr to prepare your data for plotting. If nobody brings problems and instead just stares at me, we can go over some examples and do some mob plotting - I think there's great potential for information exchange!. This event is aimed at users who have worked with data frames before and want to flex their plotting muscles, for the first or 1000th time! (All skill levels are welcome, but I usually get a few questions about the ""level"" of the event)</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Problems! Ideas!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Dinner will be generously provided by Klaviyo, and RSVPs will close at 4pm one day before the event in order for the attendee list to make its way to building security.</p> "

Mara currently works as ""tidyverse developer advocate"" at RStudio. She has an amazing talent in digging into heavily technical subject matters, and presenting them in an easy-to-understand form for less-technical audience.</p> <p>Here is the abstract of Mara's talk:</p> <p>""The boundaries of science and its constituent disciplines have never been static. Nevertheless, these boundaries and their associated terms have been fiercely defended and debated from within. Scientific norms and authority are established with an audience in mind — the public, policymakers, stakeholders, and even institutions. Though 'public understanding of science' has been the subject of academic inquiry for several decades, the channels and opportunities for engagement have changed dramatically with the rise of social media, and 'democratized' vectors of communication, including the co-production of open-source software.""</p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided by our awesome hosts!</p> <p>We request that you share a full name through the RSVP (only goes to organizers) so we can accommodate our host's security practices.</p> "

Sit back and relax: we're watching videos this month.</p> <p>RStudio::conf is an annual conference (next one: January 2019) run by RStudio that is very popular, and luckily very good about putting videos of their talks online: <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/rstudioconf-2018-talks/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/rstudioconf-2018-talks/</a> (we can also watch ones from other years)</p> <p>We'll be taking suggestions in the comments ahead of time, and voting/agreeing on which 3-5 videos to watch at the meetup. BUT it will be much better than watching them alone, because we can discuss them together afterward, helping each other understand and build on the content. Sorry if this sounds dorky, it was really great last time!</p> <p>If we don't get a discussion going in the comments, we might post some here to get things in gear. Keep in mind that if we want to watch several videos (and keep everyone's attention!) the shorter ones (~20min) are probably the best bet.</p> <p>Pizza dinner will be generously provided by Klaviyo!</p> "

We will start from the very basics of version control (collaborating with your past self) and work up to the skills necessary to contribute to an existing open source project (collaborating with other people). Effective collaboration and version control are essential for researchers to easily recover from the nasty snafus that we (or our collaborators) can get ourselves into through better file management. So, what are you waiting for? Let's get git-ting!</p> <p><i><b>Pre-workshop Homework</b>:</i></p> <p>If you plan on attending this workshop, please do the following two things ahead of time: </p> <p>• Sign up for GitHub (<a href=""http://github.com/""><a href=""http://github.com"" class=""linkified"">http://github.com</a></a>)</p> <p>• Install SourceTree client for Git (<a href=""https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/""><a href=""https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/</a></a>)</p> "

R-Ladies Paris,Creating reproducible reports and journal articles using RMarkdown,2017-01-17,18:00,17,"<p>When writing a report based on data, one usually has to rely on copying and pasting figures and results between a statistical programming environment of choice (of course, we prefer R) and a document editor.

Natural History Museums and Botanical Gardens have been digitizing their collections for over ten years yielding billions of data points culminating in one of the most exciting data resources the world has to offer. Evolutionary Biologist, Ciera Martinez, will be speaking about biodiversity data and her work as a current Mozilla Science Fellow. Her and her team have been working at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science exploring what the world of biodiversity data has to offer. You learn more about this project at curiositydata.org. In addition to talking about her biodiversity data project, she will speak about data science in academia and will host a brief workshop on how to use R to map fossils of extinct animals.</p> <p>Survival analysis (Mathilde):</p> <p>Data where value of a measurement or of an observation is partially known is defined as censored data. This type of data is very common in biomedical sciences, social sciences, engineering and ecology and particular care is required in their analysis. To deal with such data, survival analysis can be used.</p> <p>One of the main purposes of survival analysis is to estimate survival functions, i.e. the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, and their dependence on explanatory variables. In this presentation, we will see the caracteristics of this collection of statistical methods and their implementation in R, through the survival R package. Let's do survival analyses without suffering!</p> "

Tamara es profesora en el MIT (EEUU) y trabaja en las áreas de aprendizaje automático y estadística.</p> <p>ORGANIZACIÓN:<br/>Seguirmos la charla online desde nuestro Slack (un espacio de trabajo online, parecido a un chat). El ingreso al Slack es bajo invitación, por lo que te pedimos que nos envíes un email a [masked] para que podamos incluirte al mismo. Una vez ahí, dejá una pequeña presentación en el canal #general.</p> <p>Como la charla es en inglés, desde el Slack iremos discutiendo y comentando en español, para ayudarnos entre todes y sacarle provecho a esta increíble visita.</p> <p>CHARLA:<br/>Idioma: Inglés</p> <p>Tema: Automated Scalable Bayesian Inference via Data Summarization</p> <p>Resúmen: Abstract: The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive because of the rich hierarchical relationships, uncertainty quantification, and prior specification these methods provide. Many standard Bayesian inference algorithms are often computationally expensive, however, so their direct application to large datasets can be difficult or infeasible. We show that our method provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size. We validate on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude relative to uniform random subsampling.</p> <p>Si tenés ganas de ir leyendo sobre el tema, encontrás referencias aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2snvPb4"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2snvPb4</a> y aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA</a>.</p> "

R-Ladies San Jose,Segunda reunión R-Ladies / ggplot2,2018-01-15,18:00,9,"<p>• Lo que haremos<br/>Graficar nuestros datos es una de las mejores maneras para explorarlos y para observar las relaciones que existen entre las variables.<br/>En R existen tres sistemas principales encargados de hacer gráficos, el sistema base plotting system, el paquete lattice y el paquete ggplot2.<br/>En este taller aprenderemos lo básico acerca del paquete ggplot2. Este sistema es el más efectivo para crear gráficos con calidad para la publicación.<br/>Este paquete se construyó basándose en la gramática de gráficos, es decir, en la idea de que cualquier gráfico puede expresarse a partir del mismo set de componentes: un set de datos, un sistema coordinado, y un set de geoms -- que corresponden a la representación visual de cada dato.<br/>La clave para entender ggplot2 es pensar en una figura como un conjunto de capas. Esta idea podría resultarle familiar si ha usado un programa de edición de imágenes como Photoshop, Illustrator, o Inkscape.</p> <p>• Lo que hay que traer<br/>Computadora con R Studio instalado.</p> <p>• Información importante<br/>La reunión será en la sala de capacitaciones del segundo piso de la biblioteca Demetrio Tinoco</p> "

R-Ladies San Jose,R-Ladies / Dplyr ,2018-05-15,17:30,10,"<p>• Lo que haremos<br/>El paquete dplyr, es una herramienta alternativa en R que brinda soporte en análsis y depuración de bases de datos. Proporciona herramientas sencillas para las tareas de manipulación de datos más comunes. Está diseñado para trabajar directamente con marcos de datos, con muchas tareas comunes optimizadas al estar escritas en un lenguaje compilado (C ++). Una característica adicional es la capacidad de trabajar directamente con datos almacenados en una base de datos externa. Los beneficios de hacer esto son que los datos se pueden gestionar de forma nativa en una base de datos relacional, las consultas se pueden realizar en esa base de datos y solo se devuelven los resultados de la consulta. Esto resuelve un problema común con R en que todas las operaciones se llevan a cabo en la memoria y, por lo tanto, la cantidad de datos con la que puede trabajar está limitada por la memoria disponible. Las conexiones de la base de datos esencialmente eliminan esa limitación, ya que puede conectarse a una base de datos de muchos cientos de GB, realizar consultas directamente sobre ella y volver a incluir en R solo lo que necesita para el análisis.<br/>¡Las esperamos! 💜</p> <p>• Lo que hay que traer<br/>Computadora con R Studio instalado.</p> "

R-Ladies Tbilisi,"Data types, indexing, cleaning and preparation - for beginners!",2017-12-14,19:00,8,"<p>The next meetup is on December 14. This is suitable for beginners - it is a good continuation of the beginners' workshop this fall.</p> <p>During the session we solidify our knowledge of fundamental data structures in R and then learn efficient approaches of preparing data sets for analysis. First topic is very important for beginners: we must clearly understand how data are stored in R.<br/>Here we will discuss basic data types (vectors of logical, integer, numeric, character values) and more advanced types (lists and data frames). Also we will touch element indexing in R (e.g. why there are three ways to extract elements from a list: dollar sign, square brackets and double square brackets).</p> <p>Second part is useful to get more efficient and faster at data cleaning and preparation. It's a common problem for data scientists: we spend about 80% of our time moving cells, rows and columns around to get them ready for a specific analytical procedure. So to get more job done we must be efficient in data management. We will look at two modern R packages: dplyr and tidyr. They are like a Swiss Army knife for a data scientist, and we have low chances to survive in R community without them. These packages allow us to produce more elegant code that leads to faster development and reduces risk of errors. 30 minutes of Excel spreadsheet tasks can be completed with 3 lines of R code with these packages.</p> <p>The meetup will be hosted by Alexander Matrunich, in English.</p> <p>================================================</p> <p>შემდეგი შეხვედრა გაიმართება 14 დეკემბერს. ეს შეხვედრა, რომელიც კარგი გაგრძელებაა შემოდგომის სემინარებისა, ორიენტირებული იქნება დამწყებებზე. ამ სესიაზე გავამყარებთ ჩვენს ცოდნას მონაცემთა სტრუქტურაზე და ვისწავლით სასარგებლო გზებს მონაცემების მოსამზადებლად ანალიზისთვის. პირველი თემა ძალიან მნიშვნელოვანია დამწყბეთათვის: ჩვენ კარგად უნდა გავიგოთ, თუ როგორაა მონაცემები დახარისხებული R-ში. განვიხილავთ მონაცემთა საბაზისო და უფრო რთულ ტიპებს. ასევე შევეხებით ინდექსირებას. მეორე ნაწილი შეეხება მონაცემების სწრაფ გაწმენდასა და მომზადებას. ეს მონაცემთა მეცნიერებისთვის ცნობილი პრობლემაა: ჩვენ ჩვენი დროის 80%–ს სწორედ მონაცემთა მომზადებაში ვხარჯავთ კონკრეტული ანალიზისთვის. ჩვენ გამოვიყენებთ ორ თანამედროვე პაკეტს: dplyr და tidyr. ისინი ძანიალ მნიშვნელოვანია მონაცემთა ანალიზისთვის და მათ გარეშე ძნელი იქნება R-ში მუშაობა. ეს პაკეტები საშუალებას გვაძლევს დავწეროთ დახვეწილი კოდები, რომლებიც შეამცირებს მომავალი ხარვეზების არსებობის ალბათობას. ექსელის სამუშაო, რომელსაც სჭირდება 30 წუთი, R-ში შეიძლება გაკეთდეს 3 ხაზით, ამ პაკეტების კოდების საშუალებით. შეხვედრა გაიმართება ინგლისურ ენაზე და მას უმასპინძლებს ალექსანდრე მატრუნიხი.</p> "

Está particularmente interesada en inferencia bayesiana y modelos gráficos, con énfasis en el aprendizaje escalable, no paramétrico y no supervisado.</p> <p>Es una de las disertantes de la Machine Learning Summer School que tendrá lugar en Buenos Aires la semana del 18 de junio. Antes de sus charlas allí, nos visita en los meetups de R-Ladies y WiMLDS Buenos Aires. ¡¡Muchas gracias, Tamara!! ¡Es una alegría recibirte!</p> <p>La exposición será en inglés:</p> <p>Automated Scalable Bayesian Inference via Data Summarization</p> <p>Abstract: The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive because of the rich hierarchical relationships, uncertainty quantification, and prior specification these methods provide. Many standard Bayesian inference algorithms are often computationally expensive, however, so their direct application to large datasets can be difficult or infeasible. Other standard algorithms sacrifice accuracy in the pursuit of scalability. We take a new approach. Namely, we leverage the insight that data often exhibit approximate redundancies to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a ""coreset"") that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in existing Bayesian inference algorithms without modification. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset. In particular, we show that our method provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size. We validate on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude relative to uniform random subsampling.</p> <p>Si tenés ganas de ir leyendo sobre el tema, encontrás referencias aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2snvPb4"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2snvPb4</a> y aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA</a>.</p> <p>¿Te parece que este meetup no es para vos?

Data cleaning can be the most time consuming part of a statistician’s workflow, and the validity of the conclusions from a data analysis can depend on this simple data cleaning. At the Conference of Statistical Practice 2018, Molly took a short course titled “Cleaning up the Data Cleaning Process: Challenges and Solutions in R,” taught by Anne Helby Petersen and Claus Thorn Ekstrøm from the section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen. The short course introduced an R package called “dataMaid” that is a “systematic, analytical approach to data cleaning that will ensure the data cleaning process to be just as structured and well-documented as the rest of the data analysis.” In this tutorial, Molly will provide an overview of the dataMaid package and demonstrate how to use the dataMaid package to improve efficiency and accuracy in the statistician’s every day data cleaning.</p> "

In recent years she has mainly focused on R as a tool to produce beautiful (and informative!) data visualisations.</p> <p>Replace Venn diagrams with UpSetR<br/>One of the common issues in data analysis is to efficiently represent overlap between various classes of objects. The most widespread tool for the task, Venn diagrams, often have poor informative value or are hard to interpret. In this talk, Chiara will introduce UpSetR, originally developed for the analysis of genomic datasets, that provides a great alternative to Venn diagrams.</p> <p>Marian Keane, Senior Consultant Analyst at Presidion, Version 1 Company<br/>Marian works with public and commercial organisations to leverage the power of data in order to realise business goals.

We will combine data from several sources to make a map showing major geographical features in San Diego, median property values per census tract, and the flight paths of planes departing San Diego International airport. The presentation will start by plotting points in the (x, y) plane with ggplot2 and will review the key features of this package. Next, we will use ggmap to easily put those points in context on a map. Finally, we will use shapefiles to color in regions in our maps.</p> <p>All materials for the tutorial can be found here (<a href=""https://github.com/rladies-san-diego/2017-08-16_ggplot2maps"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies-san-diego/2017-08-16_ggplot2maps</a>).</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>laptop</p> <p>• Important to know</p> "

R-Ladies Miami,Handling missing data using R,2018-03-16,19:00,13,"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Mine Dogucu will be here from out of town and will be our guest speaker! She'll give a talk on Handling Missing Values with R. Whether you are an experienced R user or are just getting started, we invite you to come out!</p> <p>Bio: Mine Dogucu completed her PhD at the Ohio State University. During her graduate studies she founded R Ladies Columbus. In August 2017, she joined the Data Science Program at New College of Florida as Assistant Professor of Applied Statistics. She has been teaching statistics courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. She also has founded R Ladies Sarasota.</p> <p>Talk Abstract: It is common for data scientists and researchers to encounter missing data. The term “missing” often has a bad connotation and is usually considered a nuisance. Advances in missing data treatments such as multiple imputation and maximum likelihood procedures allow data analysts to obtain unbiased parameter estimates under certain circumstances. This talk will introduce missing data terminology and ways of handling missing data using R.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> "

R-Ladies Cape Town,Come and meet the R-Ladies community in Cape Town,2017-07-17,17:30,16,"<p>Dear All,</p> <p>Please join us for the very first meetup of the R-Ladies Cape Town chapter. R-Ladies is a worldwide organisation whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. There are many other R-Ladies chapters in cities all around the world. As an organization R-Ladies is fully inclusive of trans women, genderqueer women and non-binary people who are significantly female-identified, and the same stands for R-Ladies Cape Town. Please have a look at the R-Ladies <a href=""https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/master/R-Ladies_RulesGuidelines.pdf"">rules and guidelines.</a> </p> <p>The idea for the Cape Town chapter of R-Ladies Global is to bring together women who work with R to get to know, support and learn from each other. The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of women in every role and area of participation. You absolutely do not need to be good at R to be a part of this community.</p> <p>Here is a <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/y8csajg2"">map link</a> to the venue for the meetup. We are very happy that it is so close to public transport for people who rely on it. I know we will be meeting outside peak hours. If you have any safety concerns regarding getting to the station or getting home, please get in touch and we will find out if anyone with a car is going your way and can lift you.</p> <p>There will be some drinks and snacks to fuel the conversation. We will say a few words to kick off but otherwise please just come along, be brave and chat to people :)</p> <p>We really hope to see you there. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.</p> <p>All the best,</p> <p>Theoni, Megan and Wiebke</p> "

R-Ladies Cape Town,Applications of R: From detecting marine heatwaves to mapping out school data,2019-04-25,17:30,15,"<p>Join us for two talks showcasing some of the applications of what you can do with R!</p> <p>### Amieroh Abrahams: ""Detecting marine heatwaves (MHWs) by using R-programming""</p> <p>Over the past three decades, anthropologically mediated warming has negatively affected marine and terrestrial ecosystems. This has ultimately resulted in major consequences for humanity and natural ecological functioning. Climate change is generally understood as the long-term rise in global mean surface temperatures. Recent studies have shown an increase in the frequency of extreme events. Extreme warming events such as marine heatwaves (MHW) are defined as a discrete prolonged anomalously warm water event. Here I will demonstrate the various R packages produced and utilized by South African scientists (heatwaveR and RmarineHeatWaves) to detect these extreme events.</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>### Megan Beckett: ""Exploring the South African School Directory with R""</p> <p>South Africa has an incredibly diverse, expansive education system, with over *25 000* schools dotted across the country, ranging from dilapidated mud huts and blackboards underneath trees to state-of-the-art, high tech facilities.</p> <p>I wanted to see how I could add value by taking some seemingly forgotten Excel files from the Department of Basic Education website, and providing a visual map to explore, understand and appreciate the diversity and complexity of our education system.</p> <p>I’ll show how I used *OpenStreetMaps* to help geocode missing data for school locations, and then used *Shiny* and *Leaflet* to create an app which allows anybody to visually explore, understand and locate schools across our country, without having to delve into those enormous Excel files.</p> <p>By the end, not only will you get an idea of how easy it is to turn legacy geospatial data into something visual, interactive and informative, but you’ll also have a unique perspective into the challenges posed by South Africa’s multifarious, multilayered, multicultural and multicoloured education system.</p> "

Toute erreur se traduirait en pertes (comme par exemple des pertes humaines). Cette problématique peut également se retrouver dans de nombreux secteurs, comme par exemple la publicité en ligne (où l'utilisateur doit mettre en place deux publicités différentes) ou la finance.<br/>Cependant, il est nécessaire de collecter suffisamment de données pour trouver la meilleure solution (explorer) avant de pouvoir la mettre en production (c'est-à-dire exploiter).<br/>Les algorithmes de bandits ont été introduits pour répondre à ce genre de problématique : à quel moment dois-je stopper mon exploration pour démarrer mon exploitation?<br/>Autrement dit : comment trouver la meilleure solution tout en minimisant les pertes?</p> <p>Emmanuelle Claeys est doctorante à l'Universite de Strasbourg. <a href=""http://www.emmanuelle-claeys.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.emmanuelle-claeys.com/</a></p> <p>Programme de la soirée:<br/>18:30 Accueil<br/>18:40 Presentation par Emmanuelle Claeys<br/>19:10 Discussions</p> "

R-Ladies Strasbourg,Données en grande dimension et médecine de précision : promesses  et défis.,2019-06-14,18:30,8,"<p>Presentation par Chloé-Agathe Azencott<br/>Abstract :<br/>Deux patients présentant les mêmes symptômes n'ont pas nécessairement la même maladie, au sens ou celle-ci peut évoluer de manière très différente, et qu'un même traitement peut avoir des effets très différents. De ce constat est née la médecine personalisée, ou médecine de précision, qui vise à aussi adapter la stratégie thérapeutique aux spécificités des patients. Or ces différences entre patients<br/>s'expliquent en partie par des différences génomiques. Mettre en œuvre<br/>la médecine de précision requiert donc d'identifier, dans des jeux de<br/>données génomiques, les variables associées à la présence d'une maladie, à son évolution, ou à une réponse thérapeutique.</p> <p>Cependant, ces jeux de données comportent fréquemment largement plus de variables (pouvant aller jusqu'à la dizaine de millions) que<br/>d'échantillons (plus classiquement de l'ordre de quelques milliers), ce<br/>qui pose des problèmes tant calculatoires que statistiques.</p> <p>Dans cet exposé, je présenterai comment utiliser des connaissances a<br/>priori sur la structure des variables, qu'il s'agisse de contraindre la<br/>sélection de variables grâce à des réseaux biologiques, ou pour tenir<br/>compte des corrélations entre régions du génome, pour répondre à ces<br/>difficultés.</p> <p>Chloé-Agathe Azencott est chercheur au Centre for Computational Biology (CBIO) de Mines ParisTech, Institut Curie and INSERM.

In this fun, informal setting, participants have approximately 5 to 20 minutes to speak about R, Data Science or any other topic!</p> <p>AGENDA:<br/>6pm - 6:30pm: Networking<br/>6:30pm - 7:30pm: Lightning Talks<br/>7:30pm - 8pm: Networking</p> <p>Talks:</p> <p>- The making of a visual resume (by Diya Das)<br/>How I learned to like ggplot and peered into the abyss of grid graphics</p> <p>- R in Jupyter Notebooks (by Viviana Marquez)<br/>The ""r"" in Jupyter stands for the programming language ""R"". In this talk you will learn how to use R in Jupyter Notebooks as an alternative to R Studio.</p> <p>- sf paRks: Analyzing Park Maintenance with R (by Emily Vontsolos)<br/>Using R from data import to visualization, the Parks Maintenance team has built a data pipeline using RForcecom, and tidyverse pkgs to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. While this system has advanced the analytical strength of reporting, there are also challenges with using R for old school, PDF-style, reports. These challenges, and some upcoming improvements will be explored during this talk.</p> <p>- Random Problems with R (by Kellie Ottoboni)<br/>As part of my dissertation, I dug into the pseudo-random number generators and sampling algorithms used by common statistical pkgs. Along the way, I found an issue with the way R generates pseudo-random integers using the sample() function. I'll give an example where we'd like to generate integers uniformly on an interval, but sample produces 2x as many odd numbers as even ones.</p> <p>- Teaching visualization and ggplot2 (by Sara Altman)<br/>Most data visualization resources focus either on the mechanics of a particular visualization tool or on the craft of creating effective visualizations. I’ll talk about teaching both—the mechanics and the craft—simultaneously. I’ll also discuss some ideas for improving your own visualizations.</p> <p>- Programming with dplyr: Quasiquotation and Quosures (by Ankur Bhatia)<br/>Because most dplyr function use Nonstandard Evaluation, they don't follow the normal rules of R evaluation. This makes the goal of passing reference objects within dplyr code non-straightforward. However, through quasiquotation and quosures, R allows us to write reliable functions that incorporate dplyr verbs.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>- Diya is a biology postdoc at UC Berkeley and a fellow at the BIDS. She uses single-cell genomics to understand how regeneration works in mice.</p> <p>- Viviana Márquez is a Mathematician and Journalist from Colombia. Now pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at the University of San Francisco.</p> <p>- Emily is a Performance Analyst for the SF Controller's Office. Her work varies and includes: the City's parks, Citywide demographics, homelessness, equity, and other department-specific program evaluations. She also administers a data analytics training program (including co-teaching the Intro to R course).</p> <p>- Kellie is a fifth year PhD candidate in Statistics at UC Berkeley. Her research is at the intersection of Stats and the Public Good, with projects ranging from evaluating the evidence for gender bias in teaching evaluations to developing stats methods for post-election audits.</p> <p>- Sara works at the Stanford Data Lab, which creates innovative, project-based curricula to teach the practical skills of DS. Previously, she was a Symbolic Systems masters student at Stanford, where she researched the helping behavior of young children</p> <p>- Ankur is a data scientist at Coda focused on Growth. Before that, he worked within Airbnb's Growth DS Team. His first experience with R was at UC Berkeley as an undergrad statistics student where he wrote a lot of code of questionable quality</p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/><a href=""https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct</a></p> <p>• Refreshments and food will be provided.</p> <p>A huge thank you to Coda (<a href=""https://coda.io/welcome"" class=""linkified"">https://coda.io/welcome</a>) for hosting us!</p> "

Imagine moving your house one. Item. At. A. Time. Super painful! The better way is to put things in boxes where like things go together, and they are much easier to transport. Writing an R package is a similar thing. It’s the ideal way to transport and share your code. As Hilary Parker said in her famous blog post: “How to write an R package from scratch”:<br/>Seriously, it doesn’t have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time. (n.b. this is my attitude about all reproducibility.)<br/>This workshop is designed to have people come out feeling that making an R package is useful and worthwhile learning. You will not walk out as complete masters, but you will know how to get started with the basics, and where to go from here.</p> <p>• Speaker Bio:</p> <p>Nick Tierney recently completed his PhD in Statistics at QUT, and is now a Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University in Australia, where he works with [Rob Hyndman](<a href=""https://robjhyndman.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://robjhyndman.com/</a> ) and [Di Cook](<a href=""http://dicook.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://dicook.org/</a> ) in the NUMBAT group.

R-Ladies San Francisco,"NLP in healthcare + Functions, Packages and Visualization in R",2019-03-12,18:00,59,"<p>1. Leveraging language data in healthcare (by Robyn Ball)<br/>—<br/>Many critical questions in healthcare can only be answered by combining structured and unstructured data. Language data is the most rich and high-valued data in healthcare, yet it often is underutilized due to the complexity of developing natural language models that can extract meaningful insights. I will provide a brief overview of using NLP in the healthcare, describe Roam's general framework, and provide datasets and other resources that can be used to jump-start research projects.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Robyn Ball is a Clinical Data Scientist at Roam Analytics, where she leverages Roam’s data and machine learning assets to create analyses of patient pathways through disease and treatment progression. Dr. Ball earned her Ph.D. in Statistics from Texas A&amp;M University. She has conducted biomedical research as a NASA fellow and as an intern at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, developed novel computational methods for genomic data at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and was most recently a Senior Biostatistician at Stanford University where she collaborated with medical researchers on studies that posed methodological challenges.</p> <p>2. Functions, Packages and Visualization in R: a case study using 'cholera' (by Peter Li)<br/>—<br/>John Snow's map of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London's Soho is a classic example of data visualization. For Snow, the map served as support of his two then contested, if not controversial claims: that cholera is a waterborne disease and that the water pump on Broad Street was the source of the outbreak.<br/>To evaluate whether the map does or can support such claims, I've been developing the R 'cholera' package (CRAN and GitHub). By allowing you to compute and plot pump neighborhoods, sets of homes defined by their proximity to a pump, the package allows you to explore, analyze and test the data embedded in the map.<br/>This will be a hands-on, interactive session. There are three objectives: to introduce new techniques, and new applications of familiar techniques; to inspire you to write your own functions and packages; to put the spotlight on the science half of data science.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Peter Li is a quantitative social scientist and long time R user.</p> <p>========================================================</p> <p>AGENDA (preliminary):<br/>5:30pm - 6pm: Help with the setup (install R packages and anything else that is needed for the workshop)<br/>6pm - 6:20pm: Networking<br/>6:20pm - 6:45pm: Talk#1<br/>6:45pm - 7:45pm: Talk#2<br/>7:45pm - 8pm: Networking<br/>========================================================</p> <p>- There is parking located behind the building on Palm Avenue.</p> <p>- For those who will be taking public transportation, we will be providing complimentary transportation from Caltrain and BART via shuttles.

R-Ladies Washington D.C.,RLadies DC Book Club - Programmed Inequality,2018-12-11,18:00,4,"<p>Spend your Thanksgiving reading about the history of women in technology! Then join us for our first RLadiesDC book club meetup on 11 December at 6pm!</p> <p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262535181/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews"" class=""linkified"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262535181/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews</a></p> <p>Our first book is Programmed Inequality, which discusses how Britain lost its early dominance in computing by systematically discriminating against its most qualified workers: women.</p> <p>In 1944, Britain led the world in electronic computing. By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation's inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age.</p> <p>In Programmed Inequality, Marie Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government's systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation's largest computer user―the civil service and sprawling public sector―to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole.</p> <p>Drawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy.Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.</p> "
R-Ladies Washington D.C.,Interactive programming with R Markdown,2019-01-09,18:30,65,"<p>In this workshop, I will introduce the basics of R Markdown, including the yaml header, code chunk options, embedding external R code/html links/graphics, utilizing parameters, and other R Markdown features.

R-Ladies Washington D.C.,RLadies DC Bookclub - The Theory That Would Not Die,2019-02-08,18:00,28,"<p>Spend Friday night discussing the history of Bayes' theorem at a women-owned brewery near DC.</p> <p>Purchase the book here: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300188226/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"" class=""linkified"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300188226/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p> <p>Bayes' rule appears to be a straightforward, one-line theorem: by updating our initial beliefs with objective new information, we get a new and improved belief. To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about learning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok.</p> <p>In the first-ever account of Bayes' rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the human obsessions surrounding it. She traces its discovery by an amateur mathematician in the 1740s through its development into roughly its modern form by French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why respected statisticians rendered it professionally taboo for 150 years—at the same time that practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving great uncertainty and scanty information (Alan Turing's role in breaking Germany's Enigma code during World War II), and explains how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in the 1980s proved to be a game-changer. Today, Bayes' rule is used everywhere from DNA de-coding to Homeland Security.</p> <p>Drawing on primary source material and interviews with statisticians and other scientists, The Theory That Would Not Die is the riveting account of how a seemingly simple theorem ignited one of the greatest controversies of all time.</p> "

If you didn't care how your life looked on Instagram, or worry about what total strangers thought of you. Imagine if you could let go of the guilt, and stop beating yourself up for tiny mistakes. What if, in every decision you faced, you took the bolder path?</p> <p>Too many of us feel crushed under the weight of our own expectations. We run ourselves ragged trying to please everyone, all the time. We lose sleep ruminating about whether we may have offended someone, pass up opportunities that take us out of our comfort zones, and avoid rejection at all costs.</p> <p>There's a reason we act this way, Reshma says. As girls, we were taught to play it safe. Well-meaning parents and teachers praised us for being quiet and polite, urged us to be careful so we didn't get hurt, and steered us to activities at which we could shine.</p> <p>The problem is that perfect girls grow up to be women who are afraid to fail. It's time to stop letting our fears drown out our dreams and narrow our world, along with our chance at happiness.</p> <p>By choosing bravery over perfection, we can find the power to claim our voice, to leave behind what makes us unhappy, and go for the things we genuinely, passionately want. Perfection may set us on a path that feels safe, but bravery leads us to the one we're authentically meant to follow.</p> <p>In Brave, Not Perfect, Reshma shares powerful insights and practices to help us override our perfect girl training and make bravery a lifelong habit. By being brave, not perfect, we can all become the authors of our biggest, boldest, and most joyful life.</p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you lack the funds to purchase the book.</p> "

And why is it so hard for competent people--especially competent women--to advance?</p> <p>Marshaling decades of rigorous research, Chamorro-Premuzic points out that although men make up a majority of leaders, they underperform when compared with female leaders. In fact, most organizations equate leadership potential with a handful of destructive personality traits, like overconfidence and narcissism. In other words, these traits may help someone get selected for a leadership role, but they backfire once the person has the job.</p> <p>When competent women--and men who don't fit the stereotype--are unfairly overlooked, we all suffer the consequences. The result is a deeply flawed system that rewards arrogance rather than humility, and loudness rather than wisdom.</p> <p>There is a better way. With clarity and verve, Chamorro-Premuzic shows us what it really takes to lead and how new systems and processes can help us put the right people in charge.</p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you lack the funds to purchase the book.</p> "

For the meetup of the month, we will have a workshop on how to use RMarkdown ""How to communicate your results with Rmarkdown &amp; knitr"".<br/>Our amazing speaker this time is ""Otho Mantegazza"".<br/>Otho is going to show us how to communicate &amp; present final results in an engaged way to our audience.<br/>Our audience can be our team, non-techinical people or even creating an archive for ourselves just remember what were doing in six months from now.<br/>Enabling this R has two powerful packages to utilize: markdown and knitr. These two packages are helping us to knit together R code &amp; markdown text together super easy.<br/>These packages run R code, style text and show the results in a single output. In this way we can produce elegant and reproducible reports.<br/>Since markdown is native to HTML, its integration in R works best with html outputs, in addition we can use other packages to produce other HTML outputs such as slides, books or a blog.<br/>In this workshop Otho will show us how to use those tools and what we can achieve with them, with practical exercises and examples from his work in the field of biology and genomics.<br/>Level: beginner<br/>Be sure that you have installed the packages Rmarkdown and knitr.<br/>install.packages(c(""rmarkdown"", ""knitr""))<br/>Additional packages that you might want to try:<br/>install.packages(c(""revealjs"",""bookdown"",""blogdown"",""leaflet"",""r2d3""))<br/>Please find more info in his github: <a href=""https://github.com/othomantegazza/talk-rladies"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/othomantegazza/talk-rladies</a><br/>Otho, is a biologist &amp; a freelancer data scientist. He did his last Postdoc at IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement) and his Phd in Biology @ university of Milan. He has learned R during his PhD while producing extensive datasets in his research as he wanted to analyze them autonomously. Later, R has been fundamental in his two postdocs, where he used it on a daily basis to explore and model genomic data. First at HHU/CEPLAS, in Duesseldorf, where he used it to find targets to improve photosynthesis in crops, later at IRD, in Montpellier, where he used it to explore the genetics of Asian and African rice.</p> "

R-Ladies New York,Parallelization of Simulations with the foreach Package and Missing Data in R,2018-03-20,18:30,42,"<p>Come out to our March Meetup to hear talks from two great R Ladies!</p> <p>First up is Elizabeth Sweeney of Flatiron Health, a loyal R Ladies NYC member, who will talk about Parallelization of Simulations with the foreach R Package: Progression Free Survival Assessed Using Electronic Health Records. About the talk: In oncology, progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time to detection of disease progression or death, and is commonly captured in clinical trials as an endpoint to evaluate treatment efficacy. In trial settings, progression is assessed at regular intervals. In contrast, progression from electronic health record (EHR) data is collected at variable intervals when patients see their oncologist. Therefore, to better understand how sensitive EHR-derived real world progression variable is to treatment effects, we have designed a set of simulations of progression in both the clinical trial and EHR settings at Flatiron Health. We simulate two major sources of error (variable progression assessments and error from extracting data from the EHR), and measure the impact of these errors on our ability to detect a known treatment effect. To speed the run time of these simulations, we use the foreach package. The foreach package provides a new looping construct for executing R code repeatedly which supports parallel execution. In this talk I will give an overview of the simulations with a focus on the use of the foreach package for parallelization.</p> <p>Following Elizabeth is Mine Dogucu, founder of both R Ladies Columbus and R Ladies Sarasota, who will introduce missing data terminology and ways of handling missing data using R. Details: It is common for data scientists and researchers to encounter missing data. The term “missing” often has a bad connotation and is usually considered a nuisance. Advances in missing data treatments such as multiple imputation and maximum likelihood procedures allow data analysts to obtain unbiased parameter estimates under certain circumstances.</p> <p>About the speakers:</p> <p>Elizabeth Sweeney is a senior quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health where she works on the analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data in oncology. Previously she was a Rice Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Statistics department at Rice University. She did her PhD on methods for neuroimaging analysis in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with Ciprian Crainiceanu and Taki Shinohara. She is an avid R user and co-taught a course of neuroimaging analysis in R on Coursera called Neurohacking in R.</p> <p>Mine Dogucu completed her PhD at the Ohio State University. During her graduate studies she founded R Ladies Columbus. In August 2017, she joined the Data Science Program at New College of Florida as Assistant Professor of Applied Statistics. She has been teaching statistics courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. She also has founded R Ladies Sarasota.</p> "
R-Ladies New York,Tidy evaluation: Programming with ggplot2 and dplyr,2018-04-19,18:30,74,"<p>Please note: because of the limited space and anticipated popularity of the speaker, this event is limited to minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender. See footnote for more details).</p> <p>For this month's meetup we have a very special guest : Hadley Wickham!</p> <p>No bio can really do Hadley justice but here is what is on wikipedia currently: Hadley Wickham is a statistician from New Zealand who is currently Chief Scientist at RStudio and an adjunct Professor of statistics at the University of Auckland, Stanford University, and Rice University. He is best known for his development of open-source statistical analysis software packages for R (programming language) that implement logics of data visualisation and data transformation. Wickham's packages and writing are known for advocating a tidy data approach to data import, analysis and modelling methods.</p> <p>1. Male allies have been great supporters of the RLadies mission to promote gender diversity in the R Community. Chapters have benefitted from men speaking, donating books for raffles, offering RLadies speaking opportunities at their meetups, promoting our events, telling the women in their life about the group, and more. In the case of this event specifically, we believe the best way male allies can support us is by letting 80 minority genders get the chance to learn from Hadley.</p> "

The noisy interface between these can be an impediment to reproducibility, as well as a royal pain. I will discuss approaches I and others have tried in dealing with these issues, and why and how some have failed and succeeded. I'll also demonstrate some tools, including packages officer and rvg and some rarely used feaures of rmarkdown that ease the flow when collaborating across the divide.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Noam Ross is a Senior Research Scientist at EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit in NYC that researches the connections between human and wildlife health. Noam builds models to understand and predict disease circulation in wildlife and spillover into people. Noam is also editor for software peer review at rOpenSci, a developer collective that builds R packages and catalyzes communities to enable open research and data. He has a Ph.D. in ecology from the University of California-Davis. Follow him on twitter at @noamross.</p> <p>Title: A Data Odyssey: Communicating Results With Coworkers</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Often, data scientists are tasked with communicating their results with people in the workplace who do not share the same technical background. Bridging the gaps between parties can be a perilous journey. In this talk, I will discuss how I have attempted to navigate this tricky terrain and provide some pointers for clear language use and data visualization choices. I’ll demonstrate how I pass on insights through visualizations using packages such as ggridges and ggalluvial and how I use rmarkdown to craft reports and take my coworkers on data adventures.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Ludmila Janda is a Data Scientist at Amplify, a pioneer in K–12 education since 2000, leading the way in next-generation curriculum and assessment. Today, Amplify serves four million students in all 50 states. Luda’s work provides insights on student and teacher usage, student success, and Amplify’s broader impact.

Psychological traits are a key driver behind human interaction, behavior and emotions. Although accurate judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments.

R-Ladies St. Louis,Intro to R with DataCamp Part 1,2018-02-24,09:00,50,"<p>• LEARN:</p> <p>If you've wanted to learn to code in R, THIS is your chance. R-Ladies STL will be hosting a 4-hour cRash course on R, using DataCamp introductory modules. DataCamp has agreed to provide FREE access for all our Meetup attendees to their entire course catalog for the Meetup (and for 30 days following the Meetup!). So, even if you are not a true beginner, please join us, meet some local R-Ladies, and try a couple DataCamp courses to improve your R skills for FREE.</p> <p>There will be R-Ladies on hand to help answer questions and get you up and Running in R. We welcome all skill levels as those with some or more advanced skills can help those just getting started in R. We are hoping to have an Intro to R Part 2 at the next meeting to answer any questions from Part 1, and to continue the learning process.</p> <p>• BRING:</p> <p>Please install R and RStudio on your laptop BEFORE the meetup.

R-Ladies St. Louis,Reproducible Research in R,2018-10-03,18:00,39,"<p>If you looked back at some R code you wrote last year (or even last week), would you be able to understand what you did and why you did it? If you suddenly left your current job, would your colleagues be able to find and follow your code?</p> <p>Confusing code can cost you time, makes it harder to collaborate, and lowers the quality of work. Fortunately, there are promising practices for code formatting and other reproducible practices in R (and other coding languages) that are easy to use.</p> <p>Join Bobbi Carothers for a hands-on workshop that will:</p> <p>- Demonstrate 10 simple formatting tips to improve your R code<br/>- Introduce an R package for automatically creating a codebook from your data<br/>- Provide an introduction to GitHub and why it is useful for sharing and collaborating on code and documentation</p> <p>You will leave with access to an online Reproducibility Toolkit with tips and instructions on code formatting, data documentation, and how to use GitHub that you can use and share.</p> <p>A special THANK YOU to NetEffects for providing snacks for this Meetup and to Sense Corp for providing space!

Julia is based out of Salt Lake City, Utah and currently works for Stack Overflow as a Data Scientist. She is also co-author of the book ""Text Mining with R"" available here - <a href=""http://tidytextmining.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://tidytextmining.com/</a></p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Unstructured, text-heavy data sets are increasingly important in many domains, and tidy data principles and tidy tools can make text mining easier and more effective. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we can manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text using R packages from the tidy tool ecosystem; these tools extend naturally to many text analyses and allow analysts to integrate natural language processing into effective workflows already in wide use. We will explore how to implement approaches such as sentiment analysis of texts and measuring tf-idf to quantify what a document is about.</p> <p>IBM is sponsoring food + drinks! We will have hearty appetizers from Elephant's Delicatessen (w/ vegetarian and GF options) and a small selection of beer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages.</p> "

If you have any Oracle VM's running, they will not run with Hyper-V installed. One should be able to uninstall Hyper-V which requires another lengthy reboot and have your Oracle VM's work again.

Spotkania Entuzjastów R-Warsaw RUG Meetup & R-Ladies Warsaw,#5 Warszawskie Spotkanie Entuzjastów R,2014-10-23,18:00,34,"<p>Serdecznie zapraszamy na październikowe spotkanie entuzjastów R.<br/>Na najbliższym spotkaniu dwie prezentacje, których prelegentami będą <b>Paweł Chudzian</b> i <b>Wit Jakuczyn.</b></p> <p>Paweł opowie o tym jak „<b>jak to Rozdzielić? a może podepRzeć?</b>”. Podczas referatu dowiemy się jak w <b>praktyce skorzystać z algorytmu SVM</b> (Maszyny Wektorów Podepierających) do rozwiązania pewnego problemu klasyfikacji. Jakie mamy możliwości jeśli chodzi o implementacje, które rozwiązanie wybrać, czym one się właściwie różnią? Postaramy się odpowiedzieć na te i inne pytania.</p> <p>Tematem drugiej prezentacji będzie ""<b>Produkcyjne wdrażanie GNU R na przykładzie branży energetycznej""</b>.<br/>W referacie Wit przedstawi swoje doświadczenia w dostarczaniu produkcyjnym rozwiązań stworzonych w środowisku GNU R. Wdrożenie wielu tysięcy linii kodu w GNU R jest niecodzienne i wymagało wytworzenia odpowiednio ""dobrych praktyk"", którymi Wit będzie chciał podzielić się ze słuchaczami. Przykładem wdrożenia będzie <b>model średnioterminowy cen SPOT na polskim rynku energii</b>.</p> <p><b>BIO:</b><br/>Paweł Chudzian, absolwent Politechniki Warszawskiej. Od kilku lat zawodowo wróży z krzemu, korzystając przy tym intensywnie z R-a. Wit Jakuczun ukończył doktorat w 2006 roku w Instytucie Podstaw Informatyki PAN. Od ponad 8 lat prowadzi firmę WLOG Solutions odpowiadając w niej za sprzedaż, rozwój biznesu oraz zarządzanie zespołem analityków. Zawodowo zajmuje się dostarczaniem profesjonalnych usług modelowania matematycznego. Jego specjalizacja to rozwiązywanie wieloskalowych problemów optymalizacyjnych. Posiada także duże doświadczenie w analizie i modelowaniu statystycznym danych.

Cechy takie ma oprogramowanie<a href=""http://www.localsolver.com/""> LocalSolver</a>. Niestety jest to aplikacja zewnętrzna w stosunku do ekosystemu języka R. Z tego względu rozwiązaniem problemu było stworzenie dedykowanego pakietu localsolver, który zapewnia integrację tego oprogramowania w taki sposób, że można je bezpośrednio wykorzystywać pisząc skrypty w języku R. Zaproponowane rozwiązania architektoniczne mogą być w prosty sposób wykorzystane w innych projektach, w których wymagane jest wykorzystanie zewnętrznych narzędzi analitycznych z poziomu języka R.</p> <p>Zalety wynikające z wykorzystania pakietu localsolver zostaną zaprezentowane poprzez porównanie go z pakietem <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rglpk/index.html"">Rglpk</a> na przykładzie rozwiązania klasycznego problemu k-medoid.</p> <p>Piotr przedstawi: <b>""Rozpoznawanie własności mówcy na podstawie treści wypowiedzi na przykładzie posłów na Sejm""</b><br/>Podczas referatu dowiemy się, jak analizować tekst, by dowiedzieć się czegoś o jego autorze, np. poznać wiek lub przynależność partyjną. W tym celu przyjrzymy się sposobom ekstrakcji cech z tekstu, technikom klasyfikacji i implementacji w R. Na koniec dowiemy się, które cechy okazały się najistotniejsze, a więc jakie własności wypowiedzi najsilniej zdradzają tożsamość mówcy. </p> <p><b>BIO:</b><br/><b>Bogumił Kamiński</b> jest pracownikiem naukowym w Szkole Głównej Handlowej w Warszawie.

An insurance policy is a promise by the insurer to the policyholder to pay for future claims for an upfront received premium. As a result insurers don’t know the upfront cost for their service, but rely on historical data analysis and judgement to predict a sustainable price for their offering. This talk will give a brief overview of some techniques how risks can be modelled in R.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Emilia Kalarus, reserving and capital modelling actuary.  Last five years she spent in London helping clients in their preparations towards Solvency II.

Currently she works for Triple A – Risk Finance being responsible for GI insurance projects.</p> <p>Presentation: Non-life insurance in R</p> <p>The R statistical system is a very powerful tool in Non-life actuarial analysis.

Ciekawe rzeczy dzieją się i w Krakowie i Wrocławiu i Gliwicach i pewnie wielu innych miejscach.</p> <p>Zaczynamy klasycznie o 18 w sali 328 na MiNI PW.</p> <p>Pierwszym prelegentem będzie Dariusz Ratman z Roche. Tytuł jego prezentacji to:</p> <p><b>Automating gene expression analysis and visualisation with R/Bioconductor: bringing genomics results to scientists </b></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>Abstract:</i></p> <p><i>Rapid development of high-throughput </i><i>technologies revolutionised the way we do biological research. Widespread use of new generation sequencing removed data acquisition bottleneck and allows for easy generation of vast amounts of complex data, which poses new challenges for today's researchers.</i></p> <p><i>R language, together with Bioconductor provides a rich ecosystem of data structures and algorithms, which address many of the biological data analysis problems but effective use of these tools requires skills, which go beyond typical researcher abilities.</i></p> <p><i>In my talk I will discuss how we're using R language as a core of the web-based framework to automate gene expression analysis and provide Roche/Genentech's scientists with the tools to analyse and understand their data.</i></p> <p>Drugą prezentację poprowadzą Alicja Szabelska-Beręsewicz, i Joanna Zyprych-Walczak.</p> <p>Temat:</p> <p><b>Dyskusja biologa ze statystykiem w towarzystwie R - czyli jak znaleźć przydatne informacje w bezmiarze danych biologicznych.<br/></b></p> <p>Podczas referatu opowiemy o tym, do czego wykorzystujemy R w obszarze naszych zainteresowań związanych z bioinformatyką i biostatystyką dotyczących<br/>sekwencjonowania nowej generacji. Przedstawimy przykładowe analizy danych RNA-seq zaczynając od zliczania countów na analizie ekspresji genów kończąc. Czy da się znaleźć wspólny język biologa ze statystykiem? Czy ogrom danych genomicznych można zaprezentować w jakiś obrazowy i przejrzysty sposób? Co da się ‘wyciągnąć’ z tych Wielkich Danych i jakim to ‘Coś’ poddać analizom i interpretacji? Podczas tego referatu<br/>postaramy się odpowiedzieć na te pytania.</p> <p>I BIO prelegentek:</p> <p>Jasteśmy biostatystykami pracującymi w Zakładzie Bioinformatyki na Uniwersytecie Przyrodniczym w Poznaniu. Jesteśmy zainteresowane szukaniem matematycznych rozwiazań do biologicznych problemów, w szczególności do problemów związanych z technologią mikromacierzy i głębokiego sekwencjonowania. W naszej codziennej pracy wykorzystujemy R jako podstawowe narzędzie pracy z danymi genetycznymi. Współpracujemy w ramach interdyscyplinarnych projektów z ośrodkami w Polsce: Polską Akademią Nauk w Poznaniu, Politechniką Poznańską, Wojskowym Instytutem Medycznym w Warszawie oraz za granicą: ETH w Zurichu, Uniwersytetem BOKU w Wiedniu. W tym roku byłyśmy współorganizatorami eRum-a (Europejskiego Spotkania Użytkowników R). Dodatkowo organizujemy comiesięczne spotkania entuzjastów R w ramach Pazura (Poznańskie Zloty Użytkowników R) promując R gdzie tylko się da.</p> <p>Sponsorem naszego listopadowego spotkania jest firma Ardigen.</p> <p><img src=""https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/2/c/600_455357708.jpeg"" /></p> "

Przykładem może być wykorzystanie funkcji lapply do wykonania danej funkcji na każdym elemencie listy. Tą samą funkcjonalność w bardziej ustrukturyzowanej formie zapewnia kolejny pakiet od Hadleya: purrr.

O przydatnych rozszerzeniach pakietu ggplot2.</b></p> <p>Odkąd w ggplot2 dostępny jest oficjalny mechanizm do tworzenia funkcji geom, stat czy position, w R-owej społeczności zaroiło się od autorskich rozszerzeń pakietu Hadleya. Niektóre z nich znakomicie ułatwiają wizualizację danych w ggplot2 – na przykład pakiet <i>ggrepel</i>, który zapobiega nakładaniu się na siebie etykiet na wykresie. Niestety nie wszyscy mają czas śledzić R-bloggers i media społecznościowe w poszukiwaniu innowacji R-owych. A szkoda – skoro od pierwszej wizualizacji danych do wykresu w standardzie publikacyjnym droga jest długa i żmudna, to czemu nie skorzystać z gotowych rozwiązań? Bez automatyzacji, gotowych procedur oraz zdefiniowanych stylów nie da się efektywnie skrócić czasu poświęcanego na ślęczenie nad estetycznymi szczegółami.

Współpracuje z ekspertami i instytutami badawczymi. W chwili obecnej głównym zadaniem Departamentu jest opracowanie map potrzeb zdrowotnych. Mapy potrzeb zdrowotnych zostały odznaczone przez Kapitułę 10. Edycji Konkursu Liderów Ochrony Zdrowia, Srebrnym Liderem w kategorii Innowacyjne Pomysły w Ochronie Zdrowia</p> <p>Opis wystąpienia:<br/>W trakcie wystąpienia zostaną zaprezentowane przykłady z dwóch głównych obszarów działalności Departamentu:  budowy narzędzi analitycznych (przykładem będzie narzędzie do automatycznego generowanie raportów) i analizy danych (przykładem będzie model oparty na metodzie wyborów preferencyjnych z nieznaną liczbą zwycięzców) . Główna część wystąpienia zostanie poprzedzona prezentacją historii i zadań Departamentu.R jest doskonałym narzędziem do eksploracji danych, analiz, modelowania. W połączeniu z markdownem czy shiny daje też możliwości przygotowania odtwarzalnych raportów i interaktywnych aplikacji. W tej części prezentacji opowiemy o ewolucji narzędzi wykorzystywanych do prowadzenia analiz w Departamentu. Opiszemy, jak na przestrzeni czasu zmienił się model pracy – od niezawodnej pary Excel (w tym VBA) + Word, aż po system będący w stanie składać tysiącstronicowe dokumenty. Opowiemy o problemach na jakie natrafiliśmy próbując wdrożyć Ra jako narzędzie wspólnej pracy nad dużym projektem i przedstawimy rozwiązania jakie przyjęliśmy (tworząc zupełnie nowe problemy). W jaki sposób przygotować narzędzia do jednoczesnej pracy wielu osób, jak uniknąć problemów pt. „dziwne, u mnie działa”, dlaczego nie użyć po prostu Rmarkdown, co dalej – pokażemy, jak odpowiedzieliśmy na te i inne pytania. Na koniec opiszemy zarys TOPURa – pakietu do definiowania i konstruowania raportów z „klocków”.W opracowywanych przez Departament dokumentach, wykorzystywane są metody z szeroko pojętej analizy ilościowej i procesu wspomagania decyzji. W tej części wystąpienia, zostanie zaprezentowany model oparty na metodzie wyborów preferencyjnych z nieznaną liczbą zwycięzców, wykorzystany do wskazywania ośrodków ginekologiczno-położniczych, wykazujących  potencjał na wykonanie przynajmniej 400 porodów w przyszłości. W mapie potrzeb zdrowotnych w zakresie ciąży, porodu i połogu dokonano analizy świadczeń położniczych w Polsce w 2014 roku. W najbardziej wyróżniającej się części tych dokumentów, na podstawie struktury porodów, udowodniono że szpitale wykonujące w trakcie roku przynajmniej 400 porodów cechują się wyższą jakością świadczeń położniczych w porównaniu do tych nie spełniających tego wymogu. Kryterium 400 porodów jest obecnie wykorzystywane przez Ministerstwo Zdrowia do oceny wniosków inwestycyjnych.

Pierwsze szlify zdobywał w firmie WLOG Solutions, gdzie tworzył aplikacje w R dla klientów z różnych obszarów biznesu (m.in. sieć hurtowni części samochodowych, sieć sprzedaży detalicznej, farmacetyka). Od października 2015 pracuje w firmie ITF, gdzie zajmuje się budową hurtowni danych reklamowych (również w R) oraz utrzymaniem i rozwijaniem stworzonej przez siebie aplikacji Shiny. Z wykształcenia statystyk, absolwent matematyki MIMUW. Współautor artykułu ""Is the assessment of interlaboratory comparison results for a small number of tests and limited number of participants reliable and rational?"", w w którym opisuje użycie statystyki odpornej przy projektowaniu testów międzylaboratoryjnych . Zapalony biegacz, pasjonat książek Ursuli le Guin. W wolnym czasie zajmuje się tworzeniem modeli predykcyjnych na kaggle.com.</p> <p>Kamil Foltyński od ponad 2 lat jest analitykiem reklamy w ITF. Samych analiz od jakiegoś czasu robi mniej, bo jego czas pochłaniają m.in rzeczy techniczne jak np. przeniesienie infrastruktury zespołu na linuxa, zarządzanie 2 serwerami zespołu i bazami danych. Pozostały czas (~80%) spędza w Rstudio Server pisząc przeróżne kostki i aplikacje Shiny szyte na miarę biznesowi. Poza tym udało mu się jeszcze wdrożyć system rekomendacji osadzony w realiach firmy. O R dowiedział się studiując Informatykę i Ekonometrię na Uniwersytecie Gdańskim. Prywatnie lubi gotować, jeść - szczególnie ostre potrawy (najlepiej &gt;= 0.5 mln SHU) oraz czytywać Bukowskiego. “Don’t try”!</p> <p>Opis wystąpienia:</p> <p>W naszej prezentacji opowiemy o naszej autorskiej aplikacji shiny Panorama, jej nietypowych początkach i o tym jak stała się jednym z głównych narzędzi Media Plannerów w firmie. Zaprezentujemy dwie główne składowe aplikacji - ""banner comparer"" (narzędzie umożliwiające znajdowanie podobnych bannerów) oraz ""Media Planner Advisor"". Opowiemy o tym czym kierowaliśmy się podczas wyboru technologii (dlaczego nie Tableau, Django, a może Excel i VBA?).  Poruszymy tematy takie jak wdrażanie R w dużej organizacji (czyli JIRA i Confluence), autoryzacja w darmowej wersji Shiny oraz integracji R &amp; html, R &amp; JS, R &amp; Apache. Zaprezentujemy też nasze podejście do planowania rozwoju aplikacji na podstawie danych statystycznych z sesji oraz system oceny bannerów przez użytkowników wzorowany na facebookowych ""likeach"". Odpowiemy m.in. na pytania: Jak radzić sobie z problemem update’u aplikacji i proxy error 404? Co począć z ""leniwymi"" użytkownikami, którzy nie lubią scrollować? Jak zmniejszyć ilość zgłoszeń o błędach spowodowanych używaniem Adblock przez użytkowników? Jak spiąć aplikację z zespołowym blogiem, żeby łatwiej dodawać informacje o nowych funkcjonalnościach i problemach z zewnętrznymi źródłami danych? Jak umożliwić łatwą wymianę wiedzy Media Planner &lt;--&gt; Team Leader &lt;--&gt; Zespół Analityków Reklamy?

Takie rozwiązania mają szczególnie duże znaczenie dla różnych dziedzin nauki wykorzystujących w swoich badaniach wielkie korpusy mowy: w lingwistyce, psychologii, socjologii, nawet medycynie. Badania te polegają na mierzeniu różnych wskaźników występujących w nagraniach mowy i porównaniu ich wśród wybranej populacji, w zależności od przeznaczenia. Jako narzędzie łączące wszystko całość z punktu widzenia użytkowników, na świecie wybrano środowisko R. Celem prezentacji będzie zademonstrowanie takiej pracy badawczej na kilku przykładach oraz dyskusja na temat wdrożenia tego typu rozwiązań w Polsce.</p> <p># BIO: Danijel Koržinek jest adiunktem na Polsko-Japońskiej Akademii Technik Komputerowych. Od kilkunastu lat się zajmuje rozpoznawaniem mowy i pokrewnymi dziedzinami. Uczestniczył w kilku projektach związanych z rozpoznawaniem mowy: w środowisku telefonicznym, do transkrypcji posiedzeń Senatu RP, transkrypcji radia i telewizji, tłumaczenia mowy. Obecnie jest uczestnikiem projektu Clarin-PL, którego celem jest przygotowanie infrastruktury badawczej w dziedzinie nauk humanistycznych i socjologicznych. Poza tym, jest miłośnikiem różnych tematów uczenia maszynowego i ostatnio również języka R.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p># Świat dla Małych i Dużych - wykorzystanie języka R do popularyzacji nauki</p> <p>Bardzo często deklaracja, że ktoś zajmuje się fizyką budzi w ludziach pewien niepokój. Chciałbym pokazać, że zrozumienie fizyki nie jest niemożliwe. Błędem edukacji szkolnej, który jest przyczyną takiego przeświadczenia, jest nacisk na liczenie i zaniedbywanie zrozumienia. Założyłem bloga, którego celem jest wypełnienie tej luki. W jego tworzeniu użycie języka R i wszystkich możliwości jakie daje jest ogromną pomocą. Pokażę jak można wykorzystać wizualizację i analizę danych oraz Shiny do tłumaczenia fizyki w przystępny sposób.</p> <p># BIO:</p> <p>Daniel Rodak jest absolwentem Inżynierii Nanostruktur na Wydziale Fizyki UW.

We decided to choose assertr from many possible packages which outperforms other tools with provided features. I will discuss most of them in my presentation.</p> <p>During the analysis, we learn more about data and related problems. Well-run communication concerning state of the data can result with improvement of data collection processes, its condition, and allow us to continue our work with better results.

Spotkania Entuzjastów R-Warsaw RUG Meetup & R-Ladies Warsaw,December'18 Warsaw R Enthusiasts ,2018-12-06,18:00,55,"<p>On our next meetup, 6th Dec 18:00, we will have a chance to listen to<br/>Dr Rafael de Andrade Moral and Filip Cyprowski.</p> <p>Dr Rafael de Andrade Moral</p> <p>Bio<br/>I am a Lecturer in Statistics at Maynooth University, Ireland. I graduated in Biology and then obtained an MSc and a PhD in Statistics from University of São Paulo, Brazil. My research interests include the development and application of statistical modelling techniques to Biology and Agriculture, more specifically in relation to Animal Ecology. I am also interested in the computational implementation of statistical models, especially in the form of R code.</p> <p>Title</p> <p>Diagnostic Plots for Univariate and Bivariate Models (and Joint Models in Ecology)</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>When using univariate models, goodness-of-fit can be assessed through many different methods, including graphical tools such as half-normal plots with a simulation envelope. This is straightforward due to the notion of ordering of a univariate sample, which can readily reveal possible outliers. In the bivariate case, however, it is often difficult to detect extreme points and verify whether a sample of residuals is a reasonable realisation from a fitted model. We propose a new framework, implemented as the bivrp R package, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our framework uses the same principles of the simulation envelope in a half-normal plot, but as a simulation polygon for each point in a bivariate sample. By using algorithms of convex hull construction and polygon area reduction, we describe how our method works and illustrate its functionality with examples using simulated bivariate normal data and real bivariate count data on animal ecology. We show how different model diagnostics can produce different results and pinpoint potential drawbacks of our approach, such as the limitations in terms of computational burden and convex hull bias.</p> <p>Filip Cyprowski</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Od 8 lat związany z analizą danych i tworzeniem aplikacji analitycznych.

Nic dziwnego, że wśród deweloperów pomysły budowania w R rozwiązań produkcyjnych budzą - w najlepszym przypadku - zdziwienie. Prezentacja udowodni, że R nie tylko sprawdzi się jako język backendu, ale też że - zwłaszcza w aplikacjach zależnych od dużych zbiorów danych - może być językiem pierwszego wyboru.<br/>Tagi: software engineering, docker, test driven development, microservices, SOA</p> "

Spotkania Entuzjastów R-Warsaw RUG Meetup & R-Ladies Warsaw,5th Anniversary of RUG & Perturbation based explanations of ML predictions,2019-03-21,18:00,48,"<p>The first meeting took place on 27 February 2014 at the ICM UW. Since then, our R community has grown a lot!<br/>We would like to celebrate the 5th anniversary together.</p> <p>We will start with a talk by Professor Marko Robnik-Šikonja about local explanations of machine learning models.</p> <p>Plan:<br/>18:00-18:05 - Welcome<br/>18:05 - 18:45 - Perturbation based explanations of ML predictions - Marko Robnik-Šikonja<br/>18:45-... - Celebration with cake</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Current research into algorithmic explanation methods for predictive models can be divided into two main approaches: gradient-based approaches limited to neural networks, and more general perturbation-based approaches which can be used with arbitrary prediction models. We present an overview of perturbation-based approaches, with focus on popular methods (EXPLAIN, IME, LIME, SHAP). These methods support explanation of individual predictions but can also visualize the model as a whole. We describe their working principles, how they handle computational complexity, their visualizations as well as their advantages and disadvantages. We illustrate issues and challenges in applying the explanation methodology on practical use cases.</p> <p>Biography:<br/>Marko Robnik-Šikonja is Professor of Computer Science and Informatics and Head of Artificial Intelligence Chair at University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science. His research interests span machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery in databases, cognitive modelling, natural language processing and application of data mining techniques. His most notable scientific results concern feature evaluation, ensemble learning, network analysis, model and prediction explanation, generation of semi-artificial data, and natural language analysis. He is (co)author of more than 100 scientific publications and three open source R data mining packages.</p> <p>After the talk, we will celebrate the 5th anniversary of SER/RUG with a cake.</p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Appsilon.</p> <p>Appsilon delivers the most advanced R Shiny apps, data science consulting services and support with R Shiny and Python Dash technologies.<br/>www: <a href=""https://appsilon.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://appsilon.com/</a><br/>fb: @appsilon.company <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/appsilon.company/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.facebook.com/appsilon.company/</a><br/>twitter: @appsilonds <a href=""https://twitter.com/appsilonds"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/appsilonds</a><br/>linkedin: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/appsilon/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.linkedin.com/company/appsilon/</a></p> "

Often facing the need to group observations? That's a good presentation for you.</p> <p>## Using R in palaeontology</p> <p>During the last years, data science (and R) became more and more popular in various areas of research. One of the probably most exotic domains of such usage is palaeontology. I'll show you a case study (coming directly from my PhD research), where domain expert knowledge is mixed with data science approach.<br/>Trilobites are one of the most fascinating extinct animals. Various shapes, sizes, environments, modes of life - all within one extinct group. Describing their systematics can lead to more complex conclusions about the shape of the whole ancient world. Trilobites from the Holy Cross Mountains are an excellent example of such importance. Laying between two major paleocontinents - Baltica and Gondwana - the exact position of this small area during Cambrian is still unclear.<br/>Studying trilobites can help in resolving this puzzle, but such old fossils suffer from various deformations, so the true diversity is hidden behind the 500 million years of history. In such cases, data science tools can help in removing the noise. I'll show you, how to use Principal Component Analysis with landmark-type data, how to remove bias, and how to interpret the results.</p> <p># Speakers bio</p> <p>Jakub Nowicki holds the PhD degree in Earth Sciences. He is an expert in morphometry and Cambrian trilobites. Currently, he works in Appsilon as a Software Engineer.</p> <p>Marcin Kosiński has a master degree in Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis specialty. Challenges seeker and devoted R language enthusiast. In the past, keen on the field of large-scale online learning and various approaches to personalized news article recommendation.<br/>Community events host: organizer of Why R? conferences.<br/>Interested in R packages development and survival analysis models. Currently explores and improves methods for quantitative marketing analyses and global surveys at Gradient Metrics.</p> <p># Sponsors</p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Appsilon.</p> <p>Appsilon delivers the most advanced R Shiny apps, data science consulting services and support with R Shiny and Python Dash technologies.<br/>www: <a href=""https://appsilon.com"" class=""linkified"">https://appsilon.com</a><br/>fb: <a href=""https://fb.com/appsilondatascience"" class=""linkified"">https://fb.com/appsilondatascience</a><br/>twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/appsilonds"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/appsilonds</a><br/>linkedin: <a href=""https://linkedin.com/company/appsilon/"" class=""linkified"">https://linkedin.com/company/appsilon/</a></p> "

Amiről szó lesz, arról alább olvashattok.</p> <p>""A csoportosítás (klasszifikáció) általánosan használt módszer a modern kutatásokban. Gyakran merül fel a kérdés, hogyan lehetne meghatározni az optimális csoportszámot. További gyakori kérdés az is hogy a csoportok között nemcsak hasonló, hanem a legnagyobb homogén csoportok is meghatározásra kerüljenek. A célok eléréséhez kidolgozásra került két hagyományos eljárást ötvöző technika, a kombinált klaszter- és diszkriminancia analízis (CCDA Kovács et al., 2014), amit olyan több származási helyről elérhető, többdimenziós adatokra fejlesztettünk, ahol minden ilyen származási helyről több megfigyelés történt. A CCDA a lineáris diszkriminancia analízis által helyesen klasszifikált esetek arányát egy véletlen beosztásból adódó- helyesen klasszifikált - arányszámhoz viszonyítja, illetve ezek különbségét nézi. Ezen értékeket tekintve objektív módon meghatározható az optimális csoportszám illetve a hozzá tartozó csoportosítás (Kovács és Erőss, 2017) és páronkénti összehasonlítások alkalmazásával képes egy rendszerben meglévő legnagyobb különbségek kimutatására (Kovács et al., 2015; Tanos et al, 2016). Továbbá a CCDA képes nem csupán a hasonló (Déri–Takács et al., 2015), hanem homogén csoportok keresésére, a csoportok közötti legkisebb különbségek megtalálására is (Kovács et al., 2014; Kovács et al., 2015).""</p> <p>Kivételesen nagyon pontosan kezdünk, így érkezzetek 10 perccel 6 előtt. Ha hoztok laptopot (hozzatok! ;)), telepítsétek mindenképp a ccda csomagot előre! A datasets-ek közül az iris adatsort fogjuk használni. További infókkal még jelentkezünk!</p> "

Minden adatelemzési, modellépítési feladat első, és talán legidőigényesebb része az adatminőség ellenőrzése, az adataink validálása, és tisztítása. A dataMaid csomag ehhez nyújt segítséget: a package-el lehetőség van egyéni igényekre igazított leíró statisztikákat és adatminőség ellenőrzéseket definiálni, amikkel az adatminőség problémák, hibák felismerhetők az adatbázisunkban. A csomag előnye, hogy a definiált tesztek, statisztikák eredményeit egy R-független, jól olvasható riportban összegzi, mely a futás paramétereit is rögzíti, ezzel biztosítva a reprodukálhatóságot. A workshop-on kipróbáljuk a dataMaid előre definiált riportját, illetve új, igényeinknek jobban megfelelő riportot is definiálunk majd.

A modellek interpretálhatóságát május 25-e óta az EU Általános Adatvédelmi Rendelete (GDPR ) is elvárja. Ehhez kapcsolódóan két csomag használatával fogunk megismerkedni, ezek a h2o és a lime csomagok. A h2o csomag AutoML függvényének segítségével megtanulunk regressziós és klasszifikációs modelleket készíteni gyorsan és egyszerűen. Ezután megnézzük, hogy a lime csomag segítségével hogyan tudjuk értékelni és értelmezni a modellek eredményeit.

Egy kötetlenebb beszélgető estét tervezünk, ahol bárki bármilyen kérdését felteheti, illetve mi magunk is készülünk egy-két témafelvetéssel.</p> <p>Ha esetleg egy kicsit elbizonytalanodtál, mert nem hallottál még Hadley-ről, akkor megnyugtatunk, dolgozni már biztosan dolgoztál vele, pontosabban az általa írt R package-ek valamelyikével. Ő alkotta meg többek között a ggplot2 csomagot, szószólója a tidy data koncepciónak a dplyr és tidyr csomagok által, megkönnyíti az életünket a readr, readxl csomagokkal, webscrapelést tesz lehetővé az rvest-en keresztül, és még sokáig sorolhatnánk a hihetetlen mértékű hozzájárulását az R univerzumhoz - nem is véletlen, hogy jelenleg ő az RStudio Chief Scientist-je, illetve emlékezhetünk rá az ""R for Data Science"" fő szerzőjeként is.</p> <p>Izgalmas estének nézünk tehát elébe - ha valamelyikőtöknek már most tolonganak a kérdések a fejében, akkor arra bíztatunk, hogy osszátok meg velünk őket, így könnyebben tudjuk előre tagolni a felmerülő témákat.

We are planning a more informal conversational event, where anyone can ask any questions – though we also try to prepare with few topics to be raised.</p> <p>If you are staggering a bit about recalling Hadley’s name, we can help where you might remember him from :) most probably you have already worked with him, or more accurate to say, with one of the R packages he has written. Among many others, he created the ggplot2 package, he is advocating the concept of tidy data through dplyr and tidyr, he facilitates our lives with the readr and readxl packages, and allows us easy webscraping through rvest. On top of it you can also remember his name as the main author of the book ""R for Data Science"". Looking at this incredible contribution to the R universe - it's no coincidence that he is currently the Chief Scientist of RStudio.</p> <p>So we are definitely looking forward to a remarkable evening - if questions and topics are already popping up in your mind, then please do not hesitate sharing them with us, so that we can better shape the flow of topics to be discussed.</p> "

Az este első felében lehetőséget kínálunk újabb tagjaink számára az R alapok megismerésére illetve felelevenítésére, a második felvonásban pedig interaktív Shiny applikáció építéssel és adatvizualizációval fogunk foglalkozni, egy Bitcoin tranzakciós adatforrást elemezve.</p> <p>17:30 - 18:00 | Megérkezés, előkészületek</p> <p>18:00 - 18:45 | Bevezetés / ismétlés az R alapokról (Klein Rita)</p> <p>18:45 - 19:00 | Szünet, frissítők</p> <p>19:00 - 20:15 | Blockchain, bitcoin, social networks - ismerkedés a fentiekkel egy Shiny applikáción keresztül (Orsós Mihály)</p> <p>20:15 - 21:00 | Levezetés, pizzázás, beszélgetés</p> <p>Az előadások tervezett tartalmát a lentiekben olvashatjátok, a szükséges anyagokat pedig az alábbi linken érhetititek el (folyamtosan kerülnek feltöltésre):</p> <p><a href=""https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_budapest/tree/master/Meetup_2019_01_21"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_budapest/tree/master/Meetup_2019_01_21</a></p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Klein Rita: Bevezetés / ismétlés az R alapokról</p> <p>Mindazok számára, akik most ismerkednek az R programozás világávál, szeretnénk egy gyors áttekintést adni a legfontosabb funkciókról, amik segíthetik a további elmélyülést, illetve remélhetőleg emészhetőbbé teszik a második előadás témáit is.<br/>Előismeretekre nincs szükség, de természetesen ha már van tapasztalatod más programnyelvekkel, illetve adatelemzési rutinokkal, az megkönnyíti a helyzetet.:)</p> <p>A főbb pontok amikkel megismerkedünk:<br/>- mi az RStudio és hogyan használjuk segítségével az R-t<br/>- mit tud egy R csomag, hogyan fedezzük fel, töltsük be és használjuk őket<br/>- milyen R objektumok és alap adatípusok vannak<br/>- hogyan olvassunk be adatokat különféle formátumokból és forrásokból<br/>- hogyan rendezzük, transzformáljuk és ábrázoljuk az adatainkat</p> <p>R és RStudio telepítési segédletet a fenti linken találtok - kérünk titeket, hogy vagy otthon készítsétek elő a környezetet a számítógépeteken, vagy érkezzetek az előadások kezdete előtti sávban, hogy legyen idő megtenni a szükséges lépéseket - személyesen többen is tudunk majd segíteni a helyszínen.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Orsós Mihály: Blockchain, bitcoin, social networks - ismerkedés a fentiekkel egy Shiny applikáción keresztül</p> <p>Hallottál már a Blockchainről? Esetleg a bitcoinról? Na és tudod-e, hogy létezik már egy Blockchain technológiára épülő social media network, a steemit.com? A steemit minden egyes tranzakciója publikusan bárki számára elérhető és lekérdezhető.</p> <p>Az előadás során megismerkedhettek a shiny nagyon egyszerű logikájával. Megtanuljátok mi az a render, reactive value és hogy miért tartom jobbnak a plotly-t a ggplotnál.<br/>Továbbá tanulmányozunk egy shiny alkalmazást, amely a steem blockchainen található tranzakciókat ábrázolja interaktív grafikonokon és teszi letölthetővé. A google analytics lehetővé teszi, hogy akár realtime monitorozd az alkalmazás nézettségét. Majd megismerhettek egy helyet, ahova ingyen lehet publikálni shiny alkalmazást.<br/>Beszélünk arról is, hogy miért kell egy kis python tudás is az R-mellé, továbbá hogyan legyen átlátható, könnyen olvasható a shiny/R kódod.</p> <p>A workshop során az alábbi csomagokat fogjuk használni, ha még nem használtátok őket, akkor érdemes őket előre telepíteni:</p> <p>“shiny”<br/>“plotly”<br/>“DT”<br/>“data.table”<br/>“shinythemes”<br/>“shinycssloaders”<br/>“shinydashboard”<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> "
R-Ladies Budapest,# R Markdown + Machine learning,2019-02-18,18:00,60,"<p>Februárban 2 éves az R-Ladies meetup!</p> <p>Ennek örömére nagyszerű programmal várunk titeket! :-)</p> <p>Két előadónk lesz szokás szerint. Daróczi Gergely, a magyar és nemzetközi R közösség elismert tagja R markdown-ról fog beszélni, Szabó Zsuzsi pedig machine learning case study-t fog bemutatni. A részleteket és a menetrendet már alább olvashatjátok.</p> <p>17:45-18:00 Előkészületek</p> <p>18:00-19:00 Szavakba öntött adatelemzés R markdown-nal - Daróczi Gergely</p> <p>Az R nyelvet általában a modellező vagy az adatvizualizációs eszközeinek köszönhetően ismerik, pedig azokon túl számos egyéb előnnyel is rendelkezik más adatelemzéssel kapcsolatos programozási nyelvekhez és környezetekhez képest -- ezek egyike a szöveges riportok (pl Word, PDF vagy HTML weblap) készítésének egyszerűsége.<br/>A workshop a literate programming és reproducible research történetének rövid bemutatásával indul arra fókuszálva, hogy hogyan ágyazhatunk be és futtathatunk programkódot egy szöveges dokumentumba annak elkerülése érdekében, hogy adatokat / eredményeket / táblázatokat / ábrákat copy&amp;paste másolgassunk dokumentumaink között; majd példakódok segítségével ismerkedünk meg a markdown formátummal, továbbá különböző típusú szöveges dokumentumokat készítünk szövegközi eredmények, automatikusan generált táblázatok és ábrák, továbbá interaktív elemek használatával.</p> <p>19:00-19:30 Szünet</p> <p>19:30-20:30 Jósoljuk meg a beton szilárdságát gépi tanulással - Szabó Zsuzsanna</p> <p>Épített környezetünk egyik fő anyaga a beton. Ennek szilárdsága igen fontos kérdés, hisz biztonságunk függ tőle. Milyen paraméterek befolyásolják a cementből és egyéb összetevőkből kikevert beton szilárdságát? A szilárdságot a receptúra alapján meg tudjuk jósolni? Ezekre és hasonló kérdésekre keressük majd a választ. A workshop során a gépi tanulás (machine learning) gyakorlati alkalmazását próbálhatjátok ki egy esettanulmányon keresztül.<br/>File-ok itt: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLRaT28_l5MTL_09gO1_JtQxH2u45Lsp?usp=sharing"" class=""linkified"">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLRaT28_l5MTL_09gO1_JtQxH2u45Lsp?usp=sharing</a></p> <p>20:30-21:00 Késések behozása :D és networking</p> <p>FONTOS!</p> <p>Frissítsétek az R-t (most sajnos tényleg hibát okozhat, ha ez elmarad)</p> <p>Az alábbi csomagokat telepítsétek:</p> <p>knitr<br/>rmarkdown<br/>shiny<br/>pander</p> <p>caret<br/>randomForest<br/>AppliedPredictiveModeling</p> "
R-Ladies Budapest,barplot(practise),2019-03-28,18:00,38,"<p>A márciusi meetup-on a vizualizáció készítésre fogunk fókuszálni.<br/>A rendezvény első felében Milibák Eszter mutat érdekes és hasznos vizualizáció készítési tippeket.</p> <p>Az R-felhasználók körében az adatvizualizáció egyik legnépszerűbb eszköze a ggplot2, melynek segítségével könnyen és rugalmasan készíthetünk áttekinthető, esztétikus ábrákat adatainkból. A meetup első felében tartott workshop keretében egy elképzelt csokoládégyár adatain dolgozva megismerkedünk az adatelőkészítés lépéseivel, a wide és a long adatformátumok közötti váltás módszerével. Ezután áttekintjük a stacked bar chartok és a multiple line charok készítésének és testreszabásának részleteit. Végül a ggplot2 egyik kiegészítő csomagja, a cowplot segítségével mini-dashboardon egyesítjük az elkészült ábrákat.</p> <p>A workshop előtt telepítendő csomagok:<br/>plyr<br/>dplyr<br/>tidyr<br/>ggplot2<br/>cowplot</p> <p>Továbbá ajánlott az alábbi cheat sheet letöltése és használata: <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf"" class=""linkified"">https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf</a></p> <p>A szükséges adatokat a githubról tudjátok letölteni:<br/><a href=""https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_budapest/tree/master/Meetup_2019_03_28"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_budapest/tree/master/Meetup_2019_03_28</a></p> <p>A meetup második felében pedig egy közös gyakorlásra invitálunk titeket.<br/>A workshop keretein belül bekapcsolódunk kicsit a nemzetközi R közösségbe, a TidyTuesday aktuális kihívását vesszük alapul. A TidyTuesday mozgalom lényege, hogy minden kedden felkerül egy témakörrel kapcsolatban adat,amelyet a vállalkozó kedvűek megtisztítanak és vizualizálnak R-t használva, lehetőleg a Tidyverse package segítségével.<br/>A meetupon az épp aktuális adathalmazzal fogunk dolgozni, önállóan vagy csapatban dolgozzuk fel, és a végén megosztjuk egymással a tapasztalatokat.</p> "
R-Ladies Budapest,edit(Google Sheet + Calendar),2019-04-29,18:00,28,"<p>Az áprilisi meetup első felében megismerkedhetünk a Google termékek, egész pontosan a Google Sheet és Google Calendar módosításainak módszerével az R segítségével.<br/>A mai világban a kollaboratív felületek, megosztott naptárak vagy épp több ember által szerkeszthető táblázatok egyre elterjettebbek, így egyre többször fordulhat elő, hogy az adataink is ilyen formárban érhetőek el. Az R segítségével lehetőség van a Google online táblázataihoz csatlakozni, módisítani, elemezni azt, vagy éppen automatizálni, személyre szabni a naptárunk frissítését.<br/>A meetupon két csomag segítségével fogunk csatlakozni a Google alkalmazásaihoz, táblázatot létrehozni, módosítani, majd pedig mindezekből egy naptárat készíteni.<br/>Az adat amit használni fogunk a hétvége folyamán lesz elérhető a lenti linken található mappában.</p> <p>Szükséges csomagok (telepítési segítség a lenti linken):<br/>- googlesheets<br/>- googlecalendar</p> <p>A meetup második felében folytatjuk tovább a vizualizációs ismereteink gyakorlását az aktuális TudyTuesday kihívás adatainak segítségével, melyet az alábbi linkem már el is érhettek.</p> <p>Meetup mappája:<br/>- <a href=""https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_budapest/tree/master/Meetup_2019_04_29"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_budapest/tree/master/Meetup_2019_04_29</a></p> "

Work hands-on with new packages and ways of doing things to achieve awesome models in many fewer lines of code.</p> <p>Using packages like dplyr, broom, modelr, recipes, h2o, and furrr we’ll see how we can go from getting data to having an amazing model in no time at all.</p> <p>This practical day will give people with experience in data science a new set of tools to implement and help them be more productive, whilst for people relatively new to data science it’ll help them get started quickly.</p> <p>About Steph</p> <p>Steph is the founder of a consultancy in the UK. Her talks, blog posts, conferences, and business all have one thing in common – they help people get started with data science. Steph holds the Microsoft MVP award for her community contributions.

Note that the book is code/language agnostic and will make for a great intro to all of the plots and concepts that Claus will cover in his talk.</p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>The R package ggplot2 provides a powerful and flexible approach to data visualization, and it is suitable both for rapid exploration of different visualization approaches and for producing carefully crafted publication-quality figures. However, getting ggplot2 to make figures that look exactly the way you want them to can sometimes be challenging, and beginners and experts alike can get confused by themes, scales, coords, guides, or facets. We will discuss best practices for getting the most out of ggplot2, including how to choose and customize scales, how to theme plots, and when and how to use extension packages.</p> <p>LOCATION<br/>Dell Medical School<br/>Health Learning Building<br/>Main Auditorium Room 1.111<br/>1501 Red River Street<br/>Austin TX, 78712</p> <p>PARKING<br/>Parking in the closest parking lot 108 is restricted to those with UT Austin parking permits.
